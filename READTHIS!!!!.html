      Thank you for purchasing the  novel.<P>
      
      Here are a few helpful hints:<P>
      
      Click the "house of cush" webpage and your book will expand.<P>
      
      Your book can be customized. If you look in the right corner you will see a button that says "tools."<P>
Because some pages have two columns of text, its recommende that this book be read in "fullpage" mode.IF YOU DO READ IN IN "BOOK MODE" DO NOT FORGET TO SCROLL UP/DOWN, AND LEFT/RIGHT.<P>

      Again thank you and I hope you enjoy.<P>
