<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">The
imperious young Astronaut seemed neither startled by the implications
of the question or affected by the impassioned, anguished tone in which
it was asked. Before he walked out and closed the door on the woman he
loved, he left her with three words which etched themselves permanently
on a heart that grew instantly as cold to him as, once, it was warm. </font><br>

<div align="center"><big><font class="fsx11" face="Times New Roman"><b>The great atrocity <br><br></b></font></big></div>

<div align="left"><big><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Everyday bitterness gnawed at his brain like starving vermin. <br><br>He was one of less than a 150 Survivors, from an entire world. <br><br>Most
things can be forgiven and if there were ever a time for Atlanteans to
come together it was now. But he could not forgive what they have done,
nor will he forget. The more he thought about the events that led to
the total destruction of his world, the more blistering the anger would
burn in his heart. <br><br>All the sordid pieces were coming together
and the mosaic that was emerging was far worse than anything he had
imagined, even though he had known them capable of depravity that would
cause the sun to vomit. <br><br>Thoughts
of murder and vengeance were
his constant companions and the only thing that gave him mastery over
the rage, was doubt. He knew of their culpability, but they had not
exploded the bombs themselves. How much blame could he justly place at
the feet of the sumerian Sorcerers, when an entire world had followed
like
sheep, and waded in a sea of blood, misery, and iniquity for a million
years, because they would not be discomforted? <br><br>Where are all the Prophets? The Meek? The Righteous? <br><br>An entire world, gone. <br><br>Who are left? <br><br>The
very Demons the old wild eyed men raved against in their ever
heightening shrill, as they tried to warn people that ignored them more
and more as each uneventful day passed.<br><br>Repent! They had
cried; of your sorceries. Repent of your murders, perversions,
robberies and oppression of the poor! Repent! Or the most high One, will
bring Its judgment upon you and cast you into the eternal fires of
hell! <br><br>But who had listened to the Prophets preaching
penitence, when all the Leaders of all stripes, with one head, were
preaching pride, nationalism, and vengeance, even as they perversely
joined their voices with those of the Prophets; warning of woes they,
themselves had called up from the pits of hades, because evil seeds begot
riches and good seeds only begot the reward of implanting angels into
the fertile womb of the Universe? <br><br>Who had listened? Certainly
not he, who had hidden himself from all the world behind the trappings
of his riches, sorceries and privileges. <br><br>From high above the
earth, in the safety of their luxurious, opulent mansions on the
Planets-- the Sorcerers, Pedophiles, Politicians, Robber Barons, and
Preachers--all the depraved Elites--the very Sinners the old Mystics had railed against, watched, in good health while the
rest of the world burned in flames. <br><br>And then there was he--with them, <i>them</i>,
as if he was one of them, instead of one of the people. It was a
painful thought but there was no point in lying to himself now. He was
with them because he was of them--his Father's son, the same Sorcerer
they are. The same obscene riches. The same privileges. The same
emotional distance from the people. The same...hatred? No! He will
accuse himself and accept many rebukes but he never hated... <i>he never hated</i>! <br><br>His
solitude was not against, or from the people, but from the world. He
became an Astronaut and lived on the planet Jupiter, not because he
hated, but because he loved. He loved, too much to face a world he knew
was suffering and dying needlessly. The only way to help the abused
people of the world was to hate and to destroy and to add more
suffering. This he could not do. <br><br>So he took his riches and ran
and hid. True, he had given away far more than he kept--but to build a
hideaway on the planet Jupiter, still took far more from the world than
one man should have claimed in an universe where a single little one
die of need. <br><br>He had watched an entire world die. He could not sleep. <br><br>But
why should he pity the willfully blind? They knew they were following
Sorcerers. They knew that they were being led by mass murderers and
thieves. They not only knew but they supported them in their genocides,
and all their crimes. <br><br>Or did they? <br><br>There was a time
before he began to question everything, when even he--with all the
resources available to the obscene rich-- had allowed himself to be
manipulated by the Demons who controlled all the instruments of
information. Yea, and even he, had supported the works of Demons as if
they were the works of Angels. <br><br>May the unknowable One have mercy on his soul. <br><br>Onanes. <br><br>The
All-father and his circle of long lived Sorcerers planned the whole
thing. But why? Why would even those powermad fiends want to destroy
an entire world? <br><br>He knew the Sumerian Sorcerers lived far
longer than he would ever know. He was only vaguely interested in their
history before-- and that-- only because he, himself, was a long lived
Sorcerer. But now, he had to know everything. They will never give him
records or tell him the truth but there were other ways of discovery.
He will find out the truth, one way or another. <br><br>But the
People...may the unknowable One, accept their atoms-- were warned. Most
of them did not elect the Guild's puppet to the office of Supreme Leader,
but when the simpleminded Fool started his campaign to bring Atlan and
all that lived upon the surface of the earth to ruin, they all
supported him. They were bewitched, but they were warned, and they did
have eyes, ears and minds of their own. They should have discerned
before the end that it was an evil angel who directed the storm that
engulfed the world in the mindless contagion of infernal chaos. But
because they thought rain was selective when it decided to fall, they
did not resist evil done in their names. <br><br>The Prophets? The
Peacemakers? The Children? The Righteous? Surely there was no justice
done to them in that great ball of flame that sunk all of Atlan beneath
the bowels of the abyss. <br><br>And what justice, that the Criminals live on to become rulers of a whole new world? <br><br>The Sumerian Guild. <br><br>He
should have expected something terrible was going to happen when they
started air lifting all their slaves and possessions into space. <br><br>Months
before what he will forever call the great atrocity, occurred, he had
watched them, polluting the serenity of his space with their "toys" and
their noise, and their unwelcome overtures to him to join them for this
or that occasion. He had left his place on Jupiter, at the behest of
the All-father, and rented a space on the moon. But he did not know
they were going to be joining him even though the All-father had never
ceased trying to get him to enter the Guild. <br>
<br>
The
moon was where the Sorcerer named Thoth's mansion was located. He had
always been curious about this one called Ibis because it was said that
the slippery character was a brother of his. Maybe in another life he
was, but in this life, he knew of no changeling brother named Thoth. <br><br>He
didn't know much about his past or his family line. He knew he was a
Halfling. He knew his father was of an old Bovine lineage that traced
all the way back to the Age of Saurian rule, when all creatures were
sentient and there was no discrimination among different species when
they sought to copulate or procreate. He also knew his father was at
least a nominal member of the Guild of Sorcerers. He knew nothing of
his birth mother, except she was of the lowly people-- the people
called abds, slaves, chattel, vermin...by the Atlantean elite. <br><br>One
of the biggest reasons that he hated the Guild, was their ceaseless
intrigues against the people of the mother he never knew. <br><br>His
mother's kind were an old race--originally called WoMans. Today they
are called Cushites by the impartial and Igigis by the profane. Due to
his father's bloodline, he was considered royalty, but following a long
line of Halflings who chose to side with their lowly blood, he
considered himself one, like that Ancient order of Halflings, who
called themselves the "sons of man" --long time, and relentless
defenders of the seed of first woman. <br><br>By
his father's blood,
he was a Magician, a strong Sorcerer, which was why Onanes hounded him
about joining the Sumerian Guild, but he was not the same type of
Magician they were, he would never go to the dead Ones for power. His
magic was enhanced by the atoms of another type of disembodied spirit.
It was the first mother of all men and woman who strengthened him. Even
so, just by opening himself up to atoms that belonged not in this
dimension, he was walking that thin, high wire, and was forever just
one
misstep from falling into the depths of abject evil. The source that
strengthened him was good, but he was weak flesh, and if he does evil,
she will flee from him, leaving a wide open void for evil atoms to pour
through. He knew the risk but he was not a weakling, and to defend his
mother's blood, he needed to be able to fight fire with fire. <br><br>The day of reckoning was fast approaching. <br><br>He
knew the Sumerian Sorcerers, were aware that far from joining them, he
was more likely to one day battle them. They in their arrogance kept
knocking at his door, as if they thought they could turn him by sheer
want of their cheerful persistence. <br><br>Finally, he resorted to
putting a ward around his space as he prepared to fly back to Jupiter.
That stopped them for a while. But he soon removed the ward because it
made him feel silly. <br><br>Being alone on an almost empty planet
with them, he had been inundated by their essence, soaked by the
quintessence of their antiquated hatred for the WoMans. <br><br>Visions
were constantly flashing before his eyes, snippets of ancient history
he had long forgot, or had erased from his mind. Today, he respected and honored the
All-father as first man, even if he did hate the way the Guild ran the world. But
when any member of the Guild was around him-- without billions of
people to convolute his or her essence--it left them naked to his
senses. He kept getting visions that Onanes--the All-father-- was a bitter enemy;that
once, in the past, he and Onanes had fought some great war. He
could remember nothing of any such war but the visions were crystal
clear and the feelings inside him roiled like an active volcano
whenever Onanes stood within his space. It was almost the same with all
of them. Could he have once battled the entire Guild?<br>
More disturbing
than the visions of ancient war, was what he was sensing about what
they were doing to some of the children of Atlan. He knew things went
on in the world that he couldn't actually personally affirm, and not go
mad with rage. Things, he wasn't ready to face. He was finding it harder
and harder to avoid the truth since he and they were alone on a planet.
He was seeing and sensing things so clearly, he was literally
sick--sick of it all; the Guild, Sorcery, Atlantis, people, the world.
He wanted to be cleansed of it all--far away from all of it. <br><br>He fell to his knees. <br><br>For
three days and nights he prayed and he knew not, if, or when he had
fallen asleep or if he had dreamed,. but he remembered the voice that
spoke to him on the forth day. Every word it said was etched upon his
brain like the carvings of a sharp blade. <br><br><br><br><b>Because
thou hath made thyself more, by drawing away to thyself more of the
energy of the One, than was thy measure, thou shall never cease to
increase, and thou shall increase each time a soul believes in thee and
calls upon thy name, and thy shall grow with power like a pregnant
woman unable to give birth, and thou shall draw to thyself the atoms,
of all innocent Beings, and by thy example, they shall strengthen the
righteousness of their own energy. Thy hatred of evil shall become
their hatred of evil, and thy love of the little ones, and all that is
righteous, just and good, shall become their love also. <br><br>Because
thou have striven to enhance thyself by practicing the vile arts of
demons, thou shall be rewarded with the increase thy sought, but it
shall not be what thy hath measured, for as the evil ones shalt
discover, when thy draw to thyself more atoms than what is thy
allotment, thy enslave thyself to thy folly, and thy increase shall
never cease. If thou art evil, all evil energy shall flow unto thee and thy
shall grow more evil and thy shall continue to increase until thy explode and
become naught but another molecule in a bigger force of evil.<br>
<br>
But when
good Atoms shall overwhelm evil atoms in the universe, the evil ones,
shall begin to decrease and the explosions of their atoms, shall leave
them less than they were before. Each explosion shall render their
atoms smaller than the one before, and eventually they will become
naught. <br><br>And so shall ye increase until ye explode, but ye
shalt become a molecule in a great force of good that shall expand
until all living things are once again united with the great source of
all that is uncorrupted creation. Then shall all living things exist
forever in peace and joy. <br>
<br>
But because thou have striven to gather more atoms than was thy allotment, thou shall be denied forever the
hunger of all consciousness, which is to materialize, and enjoy all
that I hath created for flesh and blood. <br><br>Ask not again to be
released from thy folly, but rejoice that thou hath been chosen to be a
magnet for all of suffering creation. Prepare thyself for the day when
thou shall engage the forces of evil in battle and aright what hath
been put off balance at the beginning of flesh on earth. <br><br>Because
thou hath become more than thy allotted atoms, by practicing the vile
arts of Demons, I rebuke thee and I shall exile thee and make thee as
impotent as one imprisoned behind the walls of great mountains. Thou
shall gnash thy teeth at the happenings thy see but thou shall be as
helpless as an infant to intervene until the end of thy time of
penitence. <br><br>Because thou have practiced evil only because thy
soul has hated the unjust and thy molecules and atoms has loathed the
arrogance and evil works of Demons, I shall free thee full of the rage
of thy impotence and thy might I shall enhance until thy powers shall
be as the birthright of the sun, and I shall not restrain thy rage
until all evil in the universe lies broken to pieces at thy feet. </b><br><br>So
this he had done, productively biding his time until he was ready to
face the Sumerian Sorcerers. They had stopped bothering him but he was
still constantly sick in his nature because of their presence. <br>
<br>
Finally, he was&nbsp; prepared to go back to his mansion on Jupiter. <br><br></font></big></div>
