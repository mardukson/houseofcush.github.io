REVENGE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST SORCERER </b></font><br><br><font class="fsx05" face="Times New Roman"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">If one will know the secrets of the universe, one need do naught but be quiet.</span></small> </font><br><br><font class="fsx06" face="Arial">Ten thousand years it was, that the Tys ruled the world, unmolested after Onanes was defeated. <br><br>Ten
million years the serpent Ki hid alone beneath the surface of the
earth. If it be true that wisdom is born of solitude, imagine Ye, O'
Cushite, what heights in consciousness the serpent had attained. <br><br>I venture thou cannot. <br><br>Ten
million years of bitterness, yearning and despair, so enhanced the
energy around the serpent's emotions and thoughts, that billion of
unabsorbed and loose atoms swarmed unto the serpent Ki. <br><br>Understand
now, O' Cushite, why I say to thee, never despair, never covet, never
dwell upon thy wants and pains, with overly felt passion-- for such
strong emanations are the fuel of the evil dead, and they shall swarm
to thee like flies. <br><br>All such loose atoms that are not anchored
to the first source, seeks to gather together. Being the first loose
atom, and so, the most powerful magnet of all, in an universe now
filled with independent thought forces, the serpent Ki grew with such
power that she could move mountains just by thinking it, and if she so
desired a rock, a rock would appear out of thin air. <br><br>These
things I reveal to thee, beloved Odijah, so thy will understand what
thy contend with.--why thy children are kidnapped and tortured; why thy
cousins are destroyed in endless wars. Why the poor and oppressed of
Atlan were not relieved. Misery and strong emotions fatten the evil
ones and build their strength. <br><br>This O' Cushite is what the
serpent Ki discovered in her long solitude. She discovered the great
secret of the universe and how to use the unforeseen flaw to her own
ends. <br><br>Having grown exceedingly powerful, Ki felt she was ready
to avenge herself on the Tys. But because she did naught but hide
underground while only exercising her mind for ten million years, her
body grew huge, without muscle, and she could not move easily. She
could &nbsp;lift herself above ground only with great concentration of
energy which depleted and weakened her for long periods. <br><br>What of the WoManoid, Onanes? <br><br>Know
thee, this truth, O' Cushite, and thou shalt understand all mysteries.
Know thee the history of the seeds of the serpent and thou doth not
need to know the history of the first man king. Know thee the history
of Onanes, and thou doth not need to know the history of the serpent
bloodline; for one parallels the other as two twins walking the same
path. As it was in the beginning, so it will be throughout the ages. <br><br>Onanes, like the serpent Ki, drew to himself much power from loose atoms that had not yet found anchor. <br><br>Onanes
understood the evil secret and he did naught but kill and torture
living things to draw to himself the atoms of their fear and pain. He
was the first to practice the sacrifice of flesh, to gather to himself
the atoms of death. <br><br>As he grew in power and evil, Onanes made
his energy known to Ki the serpent, and she began to concentrate upon
Onanes, for she meant to draw him to her. <br><br>And it was, that Onanes set out to find Ki the Serpent, tho' he knew naught of her existence, or whence she lay. <br><br>Heed
this warning, O' mighty one of spirit; well do I know thy heart, for it
is because I saw in thee, myself, that I was drawn to thee from the
first. I reveal not unto thee these things so thy can take the path I
hath chosen. <br><br>Well do I know of thy hatred for evil, and thy
great love and compassion for all living things. Well do I know,
beloved Odijah, that torture has never broken thy spirit. It burdens my
soul much to reveal unto thee these secrets of Magicians, for I fear
thou may see thy destiny in the pathway of fools. <br><br>Seek not O'
righteous one, to enhance thyself in the name of fighting evil, for
tho' Love, be the most powerful magnet of all, which draws from the
atoms of the unknowable One, Itself; know thee, that to enhance thyself
is to destroy thyself for all eternity, whether thy seek to do good or
evil. If thy would follow my path make sure thy love for the universe
is greater than thy love for thy self, for it requires great discipline
for any Sorcerer to resist becoming evil. More power is gained quicker
by doing evil to gather to thyself the strength of disembodied saurian
atoms, than by relying on the loose atoms of the good forces of the
universe. This is why the road to Hades is paved with good intentions.
&nbsp;<br><br>Share not this part of these documents with all the
Cushites, for such secrets are the means by which the Sorcerers hath
possessed and led all of Atlan to its death. <br><br>And now I shall conclude this document with the final and most important revelation: <br><br>Onanes
did find Ki, the serpent. The battle between the two Sorcerers to
possess the other was long and exhausting for both. In the end the
serpent Ki prevailed. She had gained the mind of Onanes, tho' it was a
precarious hold that only prevailed because Ki had promised to help
Onanes realize his own desires despite his subjugation to her. <br><br>Onanes
-- allied with the powerful, projected force of Ki -- did do battle
again with the Tys, and he did cause rocks and trees and all the beasts
on earth to war against the Tys. <br><br>And it was that the war with
the Tys raged for ten thousand years. Tho' great boulders threw
themselves upon them, trees launched spear-like at them, lions and
bears bit them, birds pecked them, waters engulfed them, and the earth
opened to swallow them,-- all the millions of Tys fought as one thing,
with one mind, and against the whole world they did not buckle. <br><br>The
new leader of the collective mind of the Tys was a winged dinosaur
called Erra. He/she had not the wisdom of Onanes and Ki, or even his
slain predecessor, but in his own right he was just as powerful because
his thoughts were limited and his hungers were insatiable. To kill and
destroy was all that he dreamed and for longer than any other living
thing, this is what he did. The atoms from such slaughter, along with
the collective he controlled, made him exceedingly strong. <br><br>The Reptile Erra was powerful indeed, and he kept the Tys strong in battle for 10,000 years against the entire world. <br><br>Ki
the serpent could see that if the war went on, no flesh would survive.
For her own survival she needed a constant supply of tortured atoms.
That meant she could not allow the WoManoids and Reptiles to make
themselves, and all other creatures, extinct. <br><br>For this reason, she ordered the mind of Onanes to talk peace with the winged dinosaur Erra. <br><br>Onanes
offered terms, which Erra understood not, but the mighty Ty did
understand the cessation of hostilities. His one track mind had
entertained by this point, a fleeting thought of a long rest. Most of
the reptiles now wanted to hibernate. <br><br>And it was that Ki the serpent, Onanes the WoManoid, and Erra the Saurian, did come to agreement and it was thus: <br><br>They
shall partition the earth, all living things, and all possessions
equally among themselves and they shall prolong their existence by
feeding equally upon the tortured atoms of Men, Beasts, and Insects.
They shall raise civilizations, and great numbers of creatures. They
shall keep their atoms in distress and whenever the creatures of a
planet reach a threshold were their troubles no longer caused them to
release atoms of distress, they &nbsp;shall destroy entire worlds and
renew their vigor thus. <br><br>This O' Cushite, are the truths that shall set thee free. <br><br>Know thy enemy or perish. <br><br>Tis all I can do for thee now. <br><br>With heavy heart, I leave thee, <br><br>Marduk. <br><br></font>
