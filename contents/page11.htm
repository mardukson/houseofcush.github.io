<p>"So, Marduk has taken off to Jupiter?" </p>

<p></p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">It was Onanes who sat at the head of the table because it was he who was Een, among the Sorcerers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was not lost on the old WoManoid --as he sensed the greed and ambition that had heightened among</font><font face="Arial" size="4"><font face="Arial" size="4"> t</font></font><font size="4">he
company he kept-- that new times and changes put new ideas into the
heads of all who choose the path of evil. It was a wary, but unfettered
figure who opened the meeting the Sumerian Sorcerers call the 'councils
of the gods'. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">So Marduk has taken off to Jupiter Onanes asked. His
inability to conceal the sound of relief in his voice did more to harm
his tentative hold on the Eenship than he knew at the time even in his
heightened state of awareness. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The one named Ki, sized him up with a subtlety that
only the one named Thoth could have noticed. Thoth had taken in the
thoughts they all tried to conceal without looking at any of them. He
didn't have to. He was not known as the brains of the Guild for
nothing. It took no special genius to discern what of room full of
vipers and serpents would be thinking when they smelled weakness. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Ki was the oldest of the female Sorcerers, yet she
retained the countenance of an innocent. She was Onanes' advisor and
main consultant. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Part of the deal that ended the war between the
Serpent, WoManoids, and Reptiles, was that both Onanes and Erra would
give seed to the serpent Ki. Because she was the last of her kind, and
because she could not physically move, she could only rule her share of
the world through her bloodline. The Hybrid by the same name, was her
first born. Being half serpent, the second generation Saurian Ki, was
also both male and female. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">She and Onanes were together so much the other
Sorcerers called her Anki, because Onanes' ritual name was Anu. She
advised him and defended him from loose talk. When he got old, she
seduced and robbed him, but that didn't stop her from hating him. She
had long been the backbone that stood him up after he grew soft and
lost many atoms to stronger magnets. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">New times and changes meant new ideas and new roles. It was time for a new Een. "<i>Enki</i>,&#8221;
that had a nice ring to it. They already called her Anki. It would be
no hardship at all for them to twist their tongues so slightly. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

<p>"We should have engaged him long ago. Did I not say that he was too
sullen to be a true Sorcerer of the circle? Whence had any one of us
seen him toying the young girls or the little boys? Whence has he been
noticed to partake of the sacrifice? Who hath seen him delight in the
slaughter of the Rabble? Is that not the Sorcerer's quickest path to
build upon our power? What true Sorcerer does not seek to enhance her
powers and riches, or to indulge in the heightening of his senses? I
have seen this one do naught but brood since the day I have met him. I,
even I, hath offered him the delights of mine own flesh, and thought I
at the time he would attack me with brutality for offering him
pleasure." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Ki fell silent and looked around the room.</font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">
"I have warned thee. Thou would not heed because ye were too lazy to
learn to chart the stars. Thou were too busy indulging thineselves to
notice that in that one's eyes, he destroys us every time he looks at
us. That one must not be allowed to remain free. We must--, all of us--
band together and slay him before he ruins us!" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#ff00ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#ff00ff" size="4">"Thou over step thy boundaries, witch!"</font></font><font size="4"> Inanna glared at the beautiful older woman whose face was not the equal of her own in symmetrical perfection, but was younger. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Ki returned Inanna's glare. </font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Ah, where have I seen that look before?" </font></font></p><font size="4">

<p>Her fresh face looked even younger as she mocked Inanna as a child would do. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Before Inanna could verbally retaliate, Thoth, known as much for his peacemaking as his wisdom spoke up: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"
I too, have long noticed that the son of the Traitor has fallen in love
with the slaves. I have raised no issue of it because without his blood
and expertise, we will not be able to return to earth when it is
habitable for us again. It is no grand matter for me to learn to
navigate our way home, but the ship we flew here--"</font></font><font size="4"> Thoth looked with all the blame and disdain he could muster at Onanes. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"--Is
only responsive to Bel Lil&#8217;s genetic code. But who knows where the
Traitor is? We have no choice but to hope Inanna's sway over the son,
serves us long enough to use him, to get us back to earth. Besides,
Marduk is the only one here, besides me, who can keep his mind off of
his crotch long enough to hold the concentration needed to Navigate the
great distance home. And I have no Astronaut training." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"Sit down, thou X chromosome!" </font></font><font size="4">Erra snarled. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Thoth clasped his hands in glee. The dumbest creature
on earth had just tried to get smart with him. His high voice resounded
even more feminine as he turned to face Erra. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"My, my, been hitting the science books lately have we?&#8221; </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Erra's retort was drowned out by the imploding laughter that erupted around the room. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"When are thou going to learn NOT to try to match wits with Azazel?&#8221;</font></font><font size="4">
Nergal said to his Kinsman. Nergal's loud voice was only slightly less
deafening than his laughter. He was the only one in the Guild, besides
Thoth, brave enough to ridicule the overly sensitive dragon, whose
brain capacity left him less a Sorcerer, than a Sorcerer's Helper.
This, even though Erra was older and had a higher rank in their house
which made him Nergal's superior. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"As I was saying: Thoth scowled at Erra. There is nothing that we can do about Marduk until he gets us back to earth." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"What makes thee think he will take us back to earth?&#8221;</font></font><font size="4"> Ki asked. </font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"He could go down himself and leave us up here.&#8221; </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Ki, Ki, Ki, or shall I say <i>En</i>ki?" </font></font><font size="4">Thoth grinned. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"Uh...thou meant to say <i>An</i>ki, didn't thou Ibis?" </font></font><font size="4">Onanes coughed uncomfortably. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Thoth stared at Ki and smiled wickedly when he saw her visibly trying to make herself smaller. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Of course I meant Anki." </font></font><font size="4">He looked at Ki harder, the smile was gone, and his eyes beamed with secret intent meant only for her. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"It's an easy enough slip to make."</font></font><font size="4"> A comprehending smile slowly spread across Ki's face as her eyes held Thoth's stare. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Thoth turned from Ki and continued: </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Marduk,
my erstwhile half-brother, will take us back to earth because Inanna
will die if he doth not--at least that's what she'll tell him. And
though he doth not use his much, he still has a crotch." </font></font><font size="4">Thoth smirked and looked at Inanna </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Is that--" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>A loud buzzing sound interrupted Thoth's pontifical exhibit and drew
all attention to Erra. Erra pressed a button on the device he wore
around his wrist and put it to his mouth. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"<i>What?</i>"</font></font><font size="4"> He yelled. </font><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"I <i>told</i> thee to nev---" </font></font><font size="4">Erra fell silent, and listened. His face registered disbelief, before a catlike grin gave malicious glee to his yellowed eyes. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"Guess what genius?"</font></font><font size="4">
Erra addressed Thoth. He looked around the room to make sure everyone
was paying attention to one of the crowning moments of his life. He
paused for maximum effect before returning his attention to Thoth. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">

<p>"That was one of my Abds. Know what he just told me Y chromosome?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"No!" </font></font><font size="4">Ninhursag exclaimed. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"That's right."</font></font><font size="4"> Erra stood up and leaned his powerful body across the shiny table. </font></p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">

<p>"Our favorite wet blanket has just taken off in his personal ship
with some of the Igigis. Anybody care to guess where he's headed?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#004040" size="4"><font color="#004040" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#004040" size="4"><font color="#004040" size="4">"Sonofva---" </font></font><font size="4">Ishkur, cursed. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"I&#8217;ll get him for this!"</font></font><font size="4">
Ki vowed. She looked at Thoth and in their mutual rage, their eyes
forged a bond that no Sorcerer had ever been willing to share enough to
make. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Nergal, who in his angst, had shifted from his WoManoid form to his Saurian state, slammed his heavy tail on the table. </font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"He's going to regret this. If it takes a million years I'm going to...to!--" </font></font><font size="4">He sputtered out into silence. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Thoth shot an accusing look at Inanna. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Ki caught his gaze. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Well half-breed whore, are thou finally with us now, or---"</font></font><font size="4"> She threw up her hands in disgust, </font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Why doth this daughter of a filthy, abd beast sit here amongst us like--" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"Enough!" </font></font><font size="4">Onanes
thundered. If the old wizard had a caring atom in his body, it was for
this beautiful last Generation WoMan female, who reminded him of a time
when he was once more of a man, than a puppet. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A backbone, he had long lost to the manipulation of
Ki the serpent, suddenly reappeared, and a tone of voice no Sorcerer of
the guild had heard in a long time, quieted everyone. </font></p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"Ibis...!"</font></font><font size="4"> the old Sorcerer, Onanes, roared. &#8220;</font><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">How long before thou can teach Erra to navigate our way back to earth?" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">A snarl of contempt raised the corner of Thoth's lips. </font><i><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Him,</font></font></i><font size="4">" he snorted in Erra's direction. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Forever." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Dismissing the thought with a wave of his hand Thoth said, </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"I will teach Nergal to steer, and I want Ki to assist me." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Erra's rage at the insult of being cast aside for a subordinate sent
his body, without word of warning, launching in Thoth's direction. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Thoth instantly shifted from his WoManoid form, to the state a long
ago foray into the depths of evil has allowed him to morph into at
will. He shot straight up in the air, his pure white wings flapping
furiously. His mouth opened, and a stream of rock melting heat directed
at Erra sent him, defensively, rocketing backwards against the walls of
the room with such force, Erra went<i> through </i>the wall. In his
WoManoid form he disappeared. Seconds later he came roaring back,
enraged with a certain fire of his own, his now huge, shimmering body
flying at Thoth like a heat seeking missile. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Nergal, his newly elevated condition having already gone to his
head, reached up and grabbed his Elder by the tail, slamming him to the
stone hard floor which such force, the big Rex, Erra, lay there for a
moment stunned between consciousness and unconsciousness. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Erra was big, and a more lethal killer than Nergal because he was
more ruthless and enjoyed it more. But Nergal, who was wingless, was
full of the atoms of a full blooded Tyrannosaurus, and was much
smarter. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Listen to me!"</font></font><font size="4"> Nergal's foghorn voice so close to the ear left Erra's appendage ringing. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

<p>"This is all Marduk's fault! And if we are going to make him pay, we need to work together!" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Thoth Harrumphed with disdain. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"I
suggest we not waste energy talking about trying to punish Marduk and
start worrying about how we are going to keep him from ruining
everything for us." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Nergal started to retort, but then he remembered the day he flew
into a rage when he felt Marduk's disapproving look upon his skin one
too many times after he had indulged himself with one of his own young
Igigis. His whole purpose for living at that moment was to snatch the
Prude's eyeballs from their sockets. </p>

<p>The last thing that he remembered about the incident was waking up
with his abds, pressing healing crystals all over his body and still
hurting like hell everywhere but on his fingernails. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He got Thoth's point. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"Get off me!" </font></font><font size="4">Erra
slapped Nergal aside with his tail and shifted back to his WoManoid
form. He glared at Thoth who tauntingly blew him a kiss. For a moment
he stiffened like a board, before seeming to make a decision in his
mind. He shook his heavy head and turned, leaving the room with slow,
heavy steps --like 500 pounds of dynamite needing nothing but the smell
of a match to blow up on everybody. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Thoth followed him moments later. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Two excited Igigis entered the hall, bowing and scraping as they inched forward. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The Cushites--along with a long list of other
names--were also once called Omans, which means beasts. To denigrate
them even more, and remove them even farther from their origins, and
hence, their inheritance--they were renamed, "Igigis" by the Sorcerers
of Sumeria. Their true title is WoManbeings. They are the uncorrupted
seeds of first woman, who is the true god and creator of their kind.
But in every age and time span, in the Ageless war between the Saurians
and the seed of woman, they are stripped of the knowledge of their
identity each time WoMankind loses the war for a period of time. Even
though they were once collectively, a little people, not much taller
than an average height of five feet, they now stood an average height
of 8 feet tall because of the interbreeding with the dominant
gene-bearing, giant Sorcerers and their seeds. Among the Sumerian
Sorcerers and their chosen ones, they were still seen as slaves or
chattel, even though overt slavery in Atlantis was abolished long ago.
Many were kidnapped as children and smuggled to different planet
hideaways. They were used for sex, and in sadistic, ritual sacrifices
to gain energy or power from the dead ones, who are the disembodied
first Generation Saurians. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">One of the Igigis who just entered the council room
was a female, the other, a male. They stood there with their eyes down,
shaking like the news they had to deliver was jumping in their blood. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">"What dost thou want?"</font></font><font size="4"> The hate in the Sorcerer's tone was so threatening, the female Igigi burst out into loud sobs. This Sorcerer's name was Hadad. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The male Igigi, older, and seemingly more accustomed
to being spoken to by the Sorcerers, lifted his head and spoke in a
smooth, calm tone that belied the shaking of his thin frame. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">"Master the--" A female Sorceress named Ereshkigal
drew her arm back and smacked the Igigi so hard, his head on his narrow
neck looked like it bounced against his shoulder blades. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#8080ff" size="4"><font color="#8080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#8080ff" size="4"><font color="#8080ff" size="4">"I told thee!"</font></font><font size="4"> She screeched.</font><font color="#8080ff" size="4"><font color="#8080ff" size="4"> "Thou are to call us Lords! <i>Lords!</i>, thy motdamned worm!" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>There was something of defiance; in the way the old Igigi seemed to
lift his head for a split moment before dropping it down and mumbling
the usual abd babble when a Sorcerer showed anger towards them. It was
something so subtle none of the Sorcerers were certain that it did
surface, even though they all felt something. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Quit farting and say thy purpose!"</font></font><font size="4"> Nergal growled at the Igigi. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">"My Eenship," The Igigi addressed Onanes. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">All the Sorcerers would have agreed, if they had
consulted with one another over the matter, that the wretched abd had
deepened his voice slightly and even put a hint of honor in the tone
when he said the next words. It was there; they would have confirmed it
if they had talked to one another, but it <i>wasn't</i> there because it couldn't have been. No son of a slave would dare act so impudent. It was inconceivable, or was it? </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">"Baal Mar," the Igigi said, and Nergal's knuckles whitened on his clenched fists. <i>Nobody told the wretched beast to call Marduk, Lord. </i></font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">"Has destroyed the spaceship." </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">There was a smile in the Igigi's voice when he said
that, or there wasn't one. It sounded like there was one, and it didn't
sound like there was one because it couldn't have been. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">This was that old relic Onanes' slave. That one
always did walk just a little too tall to be as old as he was. By that
age most Igigis were dead, or so broken, they might as well have been.
This putrid bag of bones couldn't have just raised his neck in front of
all the Assembly. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But just for making him feel that he did, Nergal,
raised his hand and sent a blue streak of death to the center of the
Igigi's chest. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">"Odijah!" The female Igigi lost her mind to terror; her screams were beyond speaking through. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nergal silenced her with another blue streak. </font></p>

<p></p><i><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font></i><p><i><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><b>"Why did thou kill the girl, rock brain?" </b></font></font></i><font size="4">Ki screamed at Nergal </font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"We have only a limited number of Igigis left and she was a breeder!" </font></font><font size="4">Ki turned to her lover Onanes, and demanded. </font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Command that Mound of useless flesh to get out of my sight!"</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"I don't leave no place unless I want to leave."</font></font><font size="4">
Nergal sat down and stretched out his legs. He received the atoms from
the female Igigi's terrorized death, and the sudden burst of energy
left him feeling momentarily indestructible. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Onanes was enraged. For more reasons than one. </font><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"I am still Eeen!" </font></font><font size="4">He
bellowed. The difference between Lord, and Lord of Lords, was the long
"E" sound. At the moment Onanes was the Lord of Lords. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Nergal, in the ultimate show of disrespect, never turned to look at Onanes when he first spoke.</font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4"> "That's supposed to mean something?" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">All the members of the Sumerian Guild of
Sorcerers were originally born of woman. They were all second
generation Saurians. Erra, born of the rape of one of the first women
sent accross the waters by Onanes, was the the son of a Ty. His mother
was a land dwelling WoManoid technically, but she was also like Onanes'
father, big, ancient and more amphibian than mammal--a crossbreed like
her son. His ruthlessness and longer arms--inherited from his mother--
made Erra the first predominantly male Saurian to rule the collective.
The females Saurians had lost face and status after Saurian supremacy
was felled by Ki, the underground serpent. After the queen was killed,
leadership became wide open to whoever was strongest to take it. That
was Erra.
</font></p><p><font size="4">Like Erra, all the members of the Guild
were the products of rape. All had varying degrees of blood ties to a
Woman but over the Ages, because they willfully worked to enhance their
Saurian blood over their WoMan blood, their atoms had been so
overwhelmed by the atoms of dead, first generation Saurians, they had
developed the same hatred and contempt for the WoManoid Onanes, as
their first Forbears had for all WoMankind. Only because Ki the
underground serpent protected Onanes, did they tolerate him. They all
knew, or believed he had grown too weak to defend himself against them.
</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Having made his point clear, Nergal shifted to face Onanes--the old beast-- who sat at the head of the councils of gods. </font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Listen,
mushskin, if thou want to pretend in thy dotage that thou art the boss
of something that's fine with me. Children play imaginary, old men play
imaginary. But don't ever take thyself seriously with me again.
Especially now. The only orders I'm taking is how to destroy Marduk. If
thou art not giving me any dictates in that direction, thou better keep
thy mouth off me." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Onanes looked around the room. Not one
Sorcerer answered his unspoken appeal. His long term Consort/Advisor
would not even look at him. He still had enough cognizance left to know
when he had been set up and betrayed. He was still a powerful Sorcerer,
with more experience and knowledge than all of them. He also had access
to the [Me], and the loyalty of the most powerful Sorceress on
earth--Ki, the underground serpent, or as the younger ones called
her--mother Tiamat. He could fight, but why? Changing times. Let them
have it. There was a Mighty One above them all. He felt himself getting
closer to that dreaded moment when he will have to face that One.
Besides, the Igigis/Omans/Cushites were his seed. Strange, how one
never really thinks about his children until he gets old and starts
craving death more than life. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The old Wizard looked again at she, who he thought really cared about him. He looked at them all, </font><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"I see"</font></font><font size="4">, he said. With one last glance at Ki, he headed for the exit. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Onanes."</font></font><font size="4">
Ki called out to him. The old Sorcerer whirled around, his heart
pounding with hope that all those years he was something more to her
than just a stepping stone. He looked at her expectantly. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Name me Eeen." </font></font><font size="4">She said. The old Sorcerer's heart dropped like a stone. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"Thou have the [Me].&#8221; </font></font><font size="4">He
answered her. He didn't want the others to know, but she had wheedled
the coveted book of powerful spells out of him long ago --which was one
of the reasons she controlled him so easily and why he was growing so
old. He consciously denied it, but inwardly, he knew she had used the
book against him. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">To the other Sorcerers he said: </font><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"I
abdicate my Eenship to Ki the Atlantean. From this time forward she is
Enki. If any will oppose this succession, let him do so now. If any is
brave enough to challenge my word, let them rise up with the full
armor. </font></font><font color="#ff0000" face="Trebuchet MS" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" face="Trebuchet MS" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" face="Trebuchet MS" size="4">Ye</font></font></font><font size="4">!" The old Sorcerer snapped at Nergal</font><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">. "Swear thy obedience to my successor, now, and then leave this room before me." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">"Nergal leapt to his feet </font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Look! I told thee--" </font></font></p>

<p></p><i><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">

</font></font></i><p><i><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"Now!</font></font></i><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"> Motdamn thee! " </font></font><font size="4">The old wizard raised his arm. Nergal grabbed his head and bellowed like a dying calf. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">After he felt Nergal had enough, Onanes dropped his arm and quit mumbling. He waited until the whimpering Ty regained himself. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"Now!"</font></font><font size="4"> He demanded. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Nergal sensed malice coming from two places. His eyes
found Ki. He swore his obedience to the new Een and left in front of
Onanes. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The new Lord of Lords turned to Thoth, who had
returned to the hall after leaving to inspect the damage that was done
to their only means of getting back to earth. </font></p><p><font size="4">Enki took in his solemn expression and knew things were as bad as she feared.

</font></p><p><font size="4">How could they have ever trusted Bel Lil?
But then again, like them all, Bel Lil, wanted to return to earth as an
indisputable god too...didn't he? He needed that ship as much as they.
And he couldn't have flown away without the rest of them, but where is
he? Enki sighed, her worried eyes meeting Thoth's irritated glare. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"We have no ship?"</font></font><font size="4"> She asked, her masculine nature already coming forth like it never had before. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"We will build another." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"How long?"</font></font><font size="4"> Enki asked.</font></p>

<p></p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"He has totally destroyed it, and laid waste to all the fuel. We
would have had to dismantle a lot of it anyway, to change the genetic
code the entire system depended on, but Marduk has all but grinded the
ship into scrap metal." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>"How long?" </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"We have nothing to build on, nothing. No one expected Marduk, or
those Igigis with him to--Listen Ki--uh, Enki...We have to rebuild from
the ground up because we have no designs, production plants, materials,
components, or skilled workers. We have to teach skills and complex
configurations to Igigis who have never been anything but toys. We have
to cannibalize everything we have in the hopes of building one ship.
Then we will have to develop another source of propulsion because there
is no uranium on this planet. In other words Lord Ki, this task will be
the equivalent of one scientist trying to teach of bunch of apes to
build a trustworthy spaceship to sail the universe." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font></font>
<p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Ibis."</font></font><font size="4"> Ki walked towards Thoth until he could feel her breath on his face. <font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"For the last time. </font></font></font></p>
<font size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">How long?" 

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font></font></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font size="4">"</font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">Ten Thousand Years Lord Ki." </font></font></font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

</font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"And what about the Noids?" </font><font color="#000000" size="4">She asked. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#000000" size="4"></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"What about them?"</font></font><font color="#000000" size="4"> Thoth hedged. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">Enki's face contorted with rage.</font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"> "You know Motdamn well what I'm asking!"</font></font><font color="#000000"> She screeched. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">For a moment Thoth stared at her, stunned. He
knew how power went to some heads. And he knew how quickly. But this
lowbrow Bitch did not just scream in his face. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">His body shimmered, and his wings started to
emerge before he remembered that Onanes said she had the [Me]. He still
would have attacked, except for out of the corner of his eye he saw
Nergal, who had returned to the room, move forward with grim
determination in his eyes. Whatever Onanes said to Nergal when they
left the room together, the big Ty had taken to heart. Thoth just
didn't want that fight right now. He stopped fading and became clear
again in his WoManoid form. He said to Ki respectfully: </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#000000"></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"We'll have to destroy them. They have been programmed to worship,
as God, the first tall ones they see. They are bound to worship Marduk
now if he makes it back to earth." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#000000" size="4">

<p>Ki swore under her breath and pivoted on her heels. She fast-walked
to the door, pressed the open button, then stopped and turned. She
glared at Thoth. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

<p>"Get us back to earth." </p></font></font><font color="#000000" size="4">

<p>Nergal followed her out the door.</p></font></font></font></font></body></html>
