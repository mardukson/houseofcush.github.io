<P></P><FONT size=4>As Inanna promised, the Cushites who served her were ready and waiting for him. They had already done most of the work of destroying the spaceship. He could only marvel at the thorough job they did, but then again, they only had one ship to destroy. He couldn't believe how utterly stupid, the self anointed rulers of the world were.
<P></P>
<P>That they would hinge the success of their entire plans on one ship, and one man--a man who had already fought two wars against them-- was far beyond stupidity and inexplicable outside of deliberate sabotage. Not that he was complaining. He was grateful for their pea brains but he wasn't going to stake anything in his battle with them on his being able to exploit the weakness of their intelligence. At times they could be very stupid but at other times, they were astronomically brilliant in accomplishing their goals--especially the one called Thoth. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He wondered if Odijah had anything to do with the wrecking of the ship. His friend had a lot of influence with the underground Cushites, who were brave enough to rebel against, and live outside the system--many of whom were personal abds of the Sorcerers who had played the loyalty role so well, they were not only beyond suspicion in Atlan, the Sorcerers had taken them with them before they destroyed Atlantis. Of course he added his own touch to the destruction--heap upon rubble-- as some would say. He could only imagine the kind of fear the Cushites with him, had to overcome to so strike against their Tormenters. Their fear of Inanna must have been far greater, for clearly their obedience to her was not out of love. They seemed too happy to leave her behind.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There were seven of them. Two Adults, two teenagers and three children under the age of ten. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He will always regret leaving the other Cushites of Atlan, behind, but he will make it up to them through these and their seed. Never will he abandon them. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
