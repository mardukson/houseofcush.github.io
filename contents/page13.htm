<P>"Will the Lord be needing company soon?&#8221; </P>

<P>Marduk broke from his thoughts and turned toward the voice behind him. It was the adult, female Cushite. Her name was Tefnut. In front of her were the three youngest children. He knew instantly what she was asking and sickness rose up in him. </P>
<P></P>
<P>That she was a slave was all that stilled his hand. That he vowed to never forsake these remnants, of the surviving Cushites of Atlan, was all that calmed his tone when he spoke to her. That he understood that every living thing is a product of its history, was what caused the huge Sumerian to kneel before the female Igigi and take her gently by the hand. </P>

<P>"The unknowable One is not evil. Thou hath not escaped into the hands of demons. Go thee forth, and succumb ne'er again, to what wars against thy Creator-given conscience." </P>

<P>The sad-eyed woman instantly burst into tears and took hold of the children as if she would smother them to death. Then just as quickly, to Marduk's astonishment, she composed herself into a queenly bearing that was as stiff as it was chillingly controlled. Marduk even thought he saw her smile--not a smile of relief, but a devious, smirk-like grin, that belied her tears and the reverent, fearful demeanor she employed when she entered his presence. He sensed something false but he didn't care enough to give it much thought. He turned back to negotiating his craft through the stars. He was heading for earth to walk its surface again for the first time in nearly 200 years. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
