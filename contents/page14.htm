<P><FONT size=4>As Marduk brought his craft into the Earth's hemisphere and hovered, carefully screening his instrument panel for a clear landing spot, he did not notice the creatures that scattered in screaming panic from the noise and heat of the discarded craft he had bought from the Atlan space program long ago. </P>
<P>He expected life to revive upon the earth, but he had not expected any large mammals or any creatures that lived above the ground to recover for another 300 years. Then again, he was no Scientist. He had undergone a generalized course during his Astronaut training, but all he really understood about the after effects of a world wide, nuclear holocaust, was that the atmosphere would kill far more than the explosions-- and would continue to kill for a long time. It had only been 196 years since the Great Atrocity.</P>
