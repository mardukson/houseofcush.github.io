<p>"Why do we have to wear these dumb suits?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">The teen-age girl pouted as she struggled into one of the single-piece space jumpers Marduk had requested that they all put on. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Her name was Nut. She was seventeen years old. She
didn't have the symmetry to her facial features that made one really
pretty or handsome, but as time passed, it was clear that she would
grow ever more pleasing to look at because she was one of those rare
people who were so openly loving and approachable, she radiated a
beauty that was beyond capturing with the naked eye. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Her father, Djhuty, reached across and smacked blood
on the young girl's lips. He looked around like a runbit surrounded by
a pack of howling hunting scrogs. </font><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">"Are you Crazy?"</font></font><font size="4"> He smacked the girl again. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Stop It!"</font></font><font size="4"> The woman, whose name was Tefnut, screamed. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The man, Djhuty, looked around, eyes darting rapidly, as if he wanted to break and run. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">"Sssssh!" </font></font><font size="4">He pleaded. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"He is not like them." </font></font><font size="4">Tefnut
said softly, as she stroked one of the children lovingly. She was a
tall woman, with a long neck and a majestic way of walking and moving
that complemented her imperious bearing, perfectly. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"We do not have to fear the big lord; he is not like the others." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>The man drew back and downed the queenly woman with a closed fist. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">"You want to get us all killed? </font></font><font size="4">He hissed. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"But the Lord said we're free!"</font></font><font size="4">
Shu, the teen-aged boy protested. He moved to position himself between
the man and the woman. He was a taller than average, skinny youth, with
the eyes and bearing of a man many times his age. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Djhuty charged the boy like an enraged Tonbig. He slammed Shu to the floor of the ship and landed on top of him. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

<p>"Do you know everything I know, boy? Have you seen the blue streak
of death strike one to the left and one to the right just because men <span style="font-style: italic;">thought</span>
about being free? Do you know what it feels like, boy, to hear your
infant seed screaming on the pit because you made noise and caught some
lurking Lord's attention? Do you know boy, what it is to be fed,
coddled, and fattened like a slog, only to end up being chewed to
pieces because some Lord decided that you hadn't looked right, or
walked right, or groveled right? Better to just shut up, obey, and keep
to the shadows. Or do you think your wisdom to be greater than mine?" </p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>The man looked around; his voice fell to a barely audible whisper </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

<p>"Forget what the Lord says, you hear me boy?&#8221; I'm your Lord, because
I know what's best for all of us. I know all the rules and laws and
shalt nots. I am the keeper of the memories of the generations that has
gone before us and I'm going to keep us alive. This is a whole new
world and a new opportunity. Just shut your mouth...all of you, carry
on like you've been born to and we may just thrive in this new world." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>The boy glowered at the man in defiance. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Djhuty covered the boy's mouth and kneed him, hard, in the groin,
and then he looked around at the woman with a threat in his eyes that
crumbled her. He glared at the teenage girl with the same look before
giving his attention again to the boy. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

<p>"You hear me?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Shu moaned his acquiescence as he writhed in pain beneath the man. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

<p>"Good, now all of you put the damned suits on. The Lord is waiting." </p></font></font></body></html>
