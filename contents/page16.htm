<P>The two creatures trembled with excitement and fear as they watched the 8 shimmering figures emerge from inside the huge planet that fell from heaven. The others had scattered when the planet first fell, and kept running, but these two, had turned back, their curiosity getting the best of their fear. They wanted to get a good look at the planet. They did not expect to see god and his children. They turned toward their village and ran like they were being chased by a pride of Daggercats. </P>

<P>Marduk did not see what made the noise from behind the cliffs but he could discern from the sounds that whatever they were, they were good sized creatures. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Impossible. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Not only that there were surface dwelling creatures of that size living, but that they were healthy enough to run so fast. What land mammal could have survived the nuclear Holocaust and recovered so quickly? </P>

<P>In the decades before its destruction, there were a lot of questionable scientific experiments going on in Atlan involving genetics and DNA. The ones the public were informed about caused a lot of heated debates. Having learned since the great atrocity how much the demons and their toadies were lying and hiding things from the people, Marduk knew there was no telling what kind of beings were behind those cliffs. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Marduk turned and saw that all the WoMans were bunched up together behind him as close as they could get and still move. That was good. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He knelt down and gathered a sample of soil in a tube. Then he stood up and captured some air in an inhaler. He surveyed the area around him for as far as he could see and decided to take the WoMans back to the ship. He wanted them to get a feel of their new home but the discovery that they were not alone made him more cautious. Tomorrow he will explore this place alone and find out who shared the earth with him and the WoMans. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
