<p><font size="4">As darkness fell, Marduk lay alone on the bed in his quarters and all he could think about was </font><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#ff00ff" size="4">HER.</font></font><font size="4">
Before he met the witch he lived the last twenty years of his life
alone and had gotten accustomed to existing without the embrace of
life. Now, all he could do was, ache for it. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#ff00ff" size="4">

<p>Inanna. </p></font></font><font size="4">

<p></p>

<p>Her face--her essence, made it impossible to sleep and he wondered
half seriously if the witch was projecting herself into his mind over
the distance of the space between worlds. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Beloved Inanna. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If anything in the Universe was going to be his victor, it was going
to be her. To want anything more than he wanted to carry out the
mission given to him by the unknowable One, would cost him the
concentration and discipline he needed to avoid becoming evil. It was
always a precarious perch between good and evil for a Sorcerer. Nothing
was more effective at pushing the Enhanced over to the dark side, than
sexual desire. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He didn't know when he fell asleep, or for how long, before he awoke
with the witch beneath him. When he closed his eyes and convulsed with
release, he wanted to hold her with the desperation of a billion lonely
years but when he opened his eyes again and reached out for her, he saw
nothing but a wet spot where before was the soma that caused the
downfall of the mighty Saurian race.</p></font></body></html>
