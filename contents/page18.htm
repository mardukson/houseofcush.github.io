<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Djhuty looked at his wife, Tefnut, as if he'd never seen her before. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Beside him, one of the three small children whimpered. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">This was the way it has always been for generations
unknown. The woman dared to not only defy him, but interfere with
his... Djhuty was too stunned to absorb it. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The little girl slipped from under his arm and ran to her mother. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I will<span style="font-style: italic;"> not </span>abide it."</font></font><font size="4">
The woman, as was her normal way, was calm but adamant. Djhuty looked
back at her with the open hatred of evil trapped in the damning light
of moral condemnation. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">She was always regal, which was why back in Atlan, he
would always beat her; to knock out of her that...that--whatever it was
that made him feel like she thought she was superior to him, even
though he was a high priest to the Lords, and she was nothing but a
slave--a slave to the Lords, and a slave to him. His fists had never
won him an ounce of concession from her, but back in Atlantis she would
have never dared to-<i>-he was the high priest of the gods! </i></font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Djhuty started to lift himself up from his bedding,
his fists were clenched tight and Tefnut had never seen his pupils so
tiny. There was murder in his eyes but she did not fear him, she had
never feared him, only the gods he represented. Even then, the fear was
only for the lives of her children. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"I will tell my--the Lord, and he will smite you with the blue fire." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>The man lost his balance and fell hard to the floor. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">"Do not!" </font></font><font size="4">He pleaded. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Even though it has always been done to the slaves and
he had lived his life seeing, and helping the Lords do far worst things
to Igigi children, he had never seen Marduk engaged in the other Lord's
favorite activities. He had never worked for Marduk and he knew of the
reputation the big Lord had for being a rebel against the Sumerian
guild. So he didn't take her threat lightly. The big Lord would punish<i> him</i>
if she told as she threatened to do, and not the woman, as another Lord
would. All Igigis knew that the Lords hated for them to show any kind
of morality, or disapproval for evil deeds because it reflected upon
them. But what the woman only recently discovered, he already knew--the
big Lord was not like the others. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"If you ever---" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">"I won't, I swear!"</font></font><font size="4">
Djhuty's atoms glowed with bitterness. Even as he groveled in fear, he
fantasized about the vengeance he would one day have on her when the
time was right. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The woman turned to go back to her own quarters </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">

<p>"Woman...?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>He had not touched her in years but he knew one part of his life was over forever. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Tefnut looked from his pleading eyes to his engorged member. For a
long moment she stood in decision before shedding her covering and
joining him on the floor. </p>

<p></p>

<p>A few minutes later Djhuty released and got up off her. He climbed into his bed and would not let her follow. </p></font></body></html>
