<p>The two creatures, who had turned back to watch the gods exit the
fallen planet, sat up from dusk to dawn, telling over and over again
what they had seen to the rest of their people. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"God. Children. Come. Planet,&#8221; said the bigger of the two, who had
monopolized the conversation when he saw how much attention everybody
was giving the story. </p>

<p></p>

<p>A fat, gray haired creature, who had already asked the question a dozen times, asked again: </p>

<p></p>

<p>"Tell. Again. God. Look." </p>

<p></p>

<p>The big creature bowed respectfully in the Fat creature's direction. </p>

<p></p>

<p>God. Big. Shine. Sun. Children. Little. Shine. Stars." </p>

<p></p>

<p>The fat creature laughed and clapped his hands with delight for the umpteenth time. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He addressed all the people. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"Now. See? Told. Gods. Come." </p>

<p></p>

<p>All the people cried with joy. Over the clamor, the fat creature yelled. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"Go! Now! All! Worship! Gods! </p>

<p></p>

<p>All the people followed the fat creature to find the gods who came down from Heaven. </p></font></body></html>
