showed up at his door. The stench of malevolence around her nearly
started a magical battle. Even more than in the others, he
sensed foul atoms inside her. The aura of such potent evil made the
depth of him strain to kill her. The hunger inside him caused him to
invite her inside instead, even though he knew she were weaving spells
and working to enchant him. He could have stopped her at any moment. He
let it go on because he wanted what she was offering him. From the moment he saw her he knew that
wherever it was she wanted to lead him, it would take all the internal
fortitude he possessed not to follow. <br><br>He felt sick from the
wrongness of it but she was beautiful beyond fantasy, and she was the
only woman he had been near in twenty earth years. <br><br>He was running,
when he left the earth and built a mansion on Jupiter. Running from a
world he sensed was on the verge of chaos. The Atlantean Elite was once
again about to throw the world into all out war, and deep down he knew
it, even though at the point when he left the earth, all he based this
belief on was intuition, influenced by nothing more than talk. Still,
he was afraid to look back as he ran--even to get a woman...afraid that
what he might see would impel him to do things he was not prepared for.
<br><br>Even if his unexpected visitor wasn't weaving her amateurish
spells, he still might have let her lead him into the embrace. What hope
had he then, when she exposed perfection before him, while her lips
moved constantly with the most sought out words of all who hunger for
lust? She reached for his lonely manhood and the instant she touched
him ancient memories flooded his consciousness. <br><br>She wasn't
just any woman, and though he didn't know her name and couldn't
remember ever seeing her face before, once inside her flesh, he
instantly knew he had been there before. <br><br><i>A man never forgets what it feels like to make love to one of his wives.</i> <br><br>That was why he followed her. <br><br>Into
the very abode of iniquity, he had moved to be with her. In the heart
of their own Guild, he sat, because she said she wanted him by her
side. <br><br>He thought he knew all the members of the Sumerian
Guild, but he had never seen her with them before, yet, it was clear
she had status among them. Where did she come from? How could the woman
have walked the same planet--no not planet--but circles, as he, and he
not know she existed? <br><br>In one night she convinced him to do
what none other had ever been able to do before. He knew that he was
in the ultimate den of iniquity and he intended to leave but not yet...
before he was turned... but not yet. <br><br>He had to get her out of
his system first. Had to get enough of her. All passions wane and dim
with time. All he needed was a little flicker in the flame and he would
flee his damnation to prepare for the day when he will return to engage
them all. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff8000" face="Times New Roman">The flame did naught but flare brighter as time passed.</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> <br><br>He
was a fool. Or he was willing to try to fool himself to be with her. He
knew the flame wasn't going to flicker because what was between he and
the woman was old and eternal. She is working for the Guild, which
means she is working against him. In other lifetimes she had often been
against him. And through the many Ages and cosmic wars he had fought
with the ancient enemy, he had always lost when she was against him.
But Ultimately, she had always returned to him. In the end they had
always finally been solely for each other, abandoning all others to
become one in mind, body, and spirit.<br>
<br>
In each Age, her reason for turning against him was different. Once it
was a lust for power or equality. Once it was out of vengeance for his
infidelity to her. Once it was because of her infidelity to him. There
were many times and many reasons that they began each new Age apart and
at war, and he knew that as long as they were stuck in this solar
system, it would always be so. It was how the Ancient enemy avoided
total defeat by the seeds of WoMan. <br><br>Is that why she was here?
Did the Sumerian Sorcerers conjure her? Or, was she always here, in a
form, or station in life he would have never recognized before he stood
face to face with her long enough to inhale her essence. <br><br>He
could feel the aura of her evil wane as his grew. It was she who began
to nudge him to leave the moon--get away from the Guild. But he would
not leave. Not without her. <br><br>He was becoming wicked for an evil witch that was becoming good for him. <br><br>If she had not loved him, he would not have chosen his flesh over the children. He thought he would be stronger. He thought he <i>was</i> stronger. <br><br>The
Sorcerers began to get bolder around him. But he already knew how they
worked. It was always the baby food first before they exposed you to
the depths of their depravity. He had become wicked for her, but he
still despised them. They thought him weaker than he was. They thought
him succumbing to their age old techniques, but he was not weak to
them, he was only weak for her. <br><br>It was getting harder and
harder to contain his nature and he knew that if he did not get out of
their sphere soon, he would engage them in battle before he was ready.
But he wanted to find a way to take her with him. They had the power of
life and death over her because she had sealed her soul to theirs. They
could torment, and break her just by speaking a word if she broke the
seal. <br><br>He was beginning to despair of keeping hold of his sanity when <i>it</i>
happened. When the world for all but 150 Atlanteans, came to a
horrifying end. He had sensed a great, coming tragedy and each year he
spent away from the earth, the feelings of something terrible brewing
grew stronger. The stronger the feeling of pending catastrophe grew,
the deeper he buried his head in the sand but his mind only envisioned
in the worst case scenario--a world war. He would have never conceived
at that point, that they would blow up the entire world.<br><br></font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">SHE</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">
had tried to keep him in bed that morning. She knew, and there was a
moment when he thought the next time he saw her, he would sear her
brain with fire. But the moment was fleeting because he convinced
himself there was nothing she could have done to stop it even if she
wanted to. She could have told him, but the witch loved him. She knew
that he would have tried to stop them. One Sorcerer, against an entire
Guild. The witch did not want him to die. He was not grateful, but she,
he might at least forgive. <br><br>The witch was in love with him. He
knew it was love because he sensed it when she stopped manipulating him
and started worrying about him. He sensed her love for him in the way
her touch changed from confidence to despair; in the weakness betrayed
by her eyes when she looked at him. He sensed it in her moans and in
the whispers and screams of her body when he embraced her inside. <br><br>They had defeated each other. <br><br>If she did not love him he would not have become evil. <br><br>He
had torn himself from the witch's embrace, not because he wanted to,
but because his senses were more heightened than they had ever been in
his life. So heightened, it didn't seem like the trouble was worlds
away, but on his doorstep. The only thing he could think of that would
distress&nbsp; him so in this place were the children. He thought the
Sumerian Sorcerers were about to sacrifice all the children in their
possession. He didn't think they would risk such an affront to him
while they had hopes of getting him to join the Guild but nothing else
explained the careening of his senses.<br>
<br>
He had long known what the Sorcerers were doing to some of the children
of Atlan. Yet, he had done nothing because his father convinced him to
stay his hand. His father, who was one of them, but who had already
fought two wars against them. They were not wars of liberation for the
oppressed Atlantean people, but petty conflicts between Elites that
killed nothing but the Cushites of Atlan. Even though he knew his
father was right about his chances of surviving a war with the Guild,
at that period, he was still wishing he had tossed the selfish Bastard
out of his way. <br><br>Damn the witch. <br><br>Damn love. <br><br>Damn the flesh. <br><br>Damn living. <br><br>Damn his Father! <br><br>He
left the witch's bed, fully prepared to meet his death. He was not
ready. But he sought them out that morning to do battle with them all. <br><br>They
were all there--gathered in the great hall, sitting around a massive,
oval table that shone like a mirror. He could tell that they had
gathered there in expectation of some monumental happening because the
aura of their anxiety almost overpowered his feeling of impending doom.
<br><br>He looked around, and saw no Cushites, or their children, but
the turmoil inside him did not recede as it should have when he saw no
little ones. Evil brought up sickness in him and the bile in his throat
was telling him something tremendously foul was about to happen, even
if it wasn't what he had rushed there expecting.. <br><br>His nature,
had heightened to the point of explosion and he was about to attack
when the great, shiny table suddenly came alive, casting a brilliance
throughout the, afore darkened room. He could see them clearly now and
he understood why none of them had reacted to the danger he posed to
them. They were all hooded with the tops of their robes. Pitch black
windows shielded their faces, and as one creature with many heads, they
stared at the table so intently, he knew they were in a group trance. <br><br>That was good for him. <br><br>Easier
for him to kill them, or if they had obtained immortality, at least
destroy their minds so they would be rendered vegetables. <br><br>He
knew he was stepping out in front of the unknowable One. He knew even
as he raised his arms to wreak destruction, he was acting more upon his
own surrender to hatred and vengeance than out of love for the
universe. He knew, even as he prepared to speak evil, he was committing
himself to the same hell as they. But he had willfully chosen his
sickness over righteousness, and it was only timing, or the hand of the
unknowable One, Itself, that voided his eternal damnation, for just at
that moment of hate filled decision, the great table briefly filled the
room with scenes and sounds of all Atlan before exploding with a light
that so assaulted the room with it's whiteness, he felt as if his
entire face had been melted from the heat of it. His eyes flared, as if
the sun and the moon had lodged within their sockets. <br><br>Through his screams, he faintly heard </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">HER</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">
calling to him as he felt his spirit receding away from him--growing
fainter and fainter until finally he succumbed to the mercy of death
and knew no more. <br><br></font></big>
