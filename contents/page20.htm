<p align="center"><b>WHEN THE BEST LAID PLANS GO AWRY. </b></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Enki, the newly appointed Lord of Lords, walked back and forth
before the assembled Sorcerers that had gathered at her imperial
request. He/She was almost entirely male now because her male aspect
commanded more respect from the other Sorcerers. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

<p>"Ibis, what are we going to do? Everything is going wrong. He...everything...he's ruining...<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span><i>verything."</i> </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Thoth tore his eyes from the scene inside the great table. He had been doing nothing <i>but </i>trying
to figure out what to do since Marduk's betrayal. He didn't have an
answer yesterday and resented like hell being called on the spot again,
today--as if he had some kind of power they didn't all have besides
more smarts. Smarts can't put a spaceship together from thin air. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Marduk was ruining everything alright. The first Person the Noids was supposed meet was him, <i>Thoth</i>,
and then the rest of these Fools. Now the Noids will have to be
destroyed and everything will have to be done all over again. By the
time a ship is ready to get him to earth there will be millions of
Noids. But so be it. They are bound to worship Marduk, now, and there's
nothing to be done with them. At least nothing he has thought of yet.
He'd really hate to destroy them--go through the whole long process
over again. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

<p>'<span style="font-style: italic;">Well</span>...?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Thoth wrestled down the urge to answer her with the honesty of his
irritation. But she was Eeen, now, and he was in an entirely different
state of mind. He no longer felt like sparring with fools. All he
wanted was to get to earth before Marduk built something with the
Igigis and Noids that the Guild would not be able to over come. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Progress with the ship was going slower than he thought it would.
Two hundred years gone by, and they haven't even gotten pass the stage
of training the Igigis to do the simplest technological jobs. None of
these fools in the Guild were any help. If he had even suspected that
Marduk would betray them so ruthlessly, he would have kept some of his
Igigi Scientists and some of the skilled laborers alive. Of course, on
the new earth, the Guild wanted nothing but unthinking beasts who would
worship and slave for them without the problems of rebellion. That's
why the Noids were created. But it was too late for ifs, and buts.
Marduk has most effectively ruined four thousand years of meticulous
planning. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Thoth answered Ki: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"I'm working on it Lord Ki. I know this is the last thing you want
to hear but I need skilled workers and meticulous Thinkers and I just
don't have any. Some of the Igigis show signs of a natural talent in
the fields we need but you know what has been done to their psyches.
They will never think beyond certain limits. It's going to take time
and a new generation of abds to complete the space program ." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>The serpent seed exploded. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

<p>"Don't thou understand, fool? Everything hath changed! We are running out of time!" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"I understand very well, Lord Ki." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Erra, who was watching them both with growing enjoyment, deflated at
Thoth's calm response to being called a fool. He wanted to see a fight.
A fight that was sure to leave Thoth humiliated and he an opportunity
to climb the ladder back up to his proper place of respect. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#ff00ff" size="4">

<p>"Ibis..." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Thoth turned to Inanna in surprise. It has been a long time since he'd last heard her voice in Council. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#ff00ff" size="4">

<p>"What if instead of just concentrating on building a ship, we developed a means to project our thoughts to earth?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Thoth was already mentally running with the idea before Inanna
finished her sentence. A great grin spread across his face as he
listened to her expand on her idea. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#ff00ff" size="4">

<p>"That way, we can influence the Noids without physically being there." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Nergal grasped the scope of Inanna's theme as quickly as Thoth did. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Can it be done, Ibis? <i>Can</i> it?"</font></font><font size="4">
His loud voice came out like a thunderous wind, -- so great was his
excitement he shifted between Saurian and WoManoid form three times
before getting control of his will. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Ishkur, Esergikel, Ki, Erra, Apep, and Hadad weren't
quite sure what Inanna's idea meant but being filled with the atoms of
a hive collective, they internalized Thoth's and Nergal's fervor and
convulsed accordingly.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Thoth felt like an Igigi that was bleeding because of the way they were all shape shifting and crowding in on him. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Onanes stared at his last Generation daughter,
morosely. He had taken steps to help his first Generation grandson
Marduk, and now Inanna had just handed the advantage back to the Guild.
He felt like crying. In fact, he always felt like crying. He couldn't
sleep for crying; couldn't eat for crying. Memories...old, dark
haunting memories that never gave him a moment's rest, tormented him
day and night. He had long ago given up trying to kill himself. He was
growing older and feebler everyday. Everything on his body ached like
an infested tooth but nothing hurt as much as his soul and he--who had
for so long played the role of Supreme Being--began to pray for death.
But <i>they</i> won't let him die. They won't let him sleep for a moment-- much less forever. 

</font></p><p><font size="4">The dead Ones.

</font></p><p><font size="4">He had forgotten so much, but what he
remembered was enough to fill a library. He looked at his seed
daughter, Inanna--at the path she was taking. He cried big, silent
tears that drowned him inside, but never let him die. Everyday since
Atlan was destroyed, he felt like a character in a dream. Did he really
destroy his own children? He had taken part in desolating many
civilizations, but he had never destroyed one filled with his own
seeds; so why does his mind continuously accuse him with such vivid
pictures? He never did such things to his children...did he? He
couldn't remember but he wouldn't...<i>would</i> he? They lie...The dead Ones.<i> They lie.</i> </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">He tried to remember backwards in time...To an Age
long passed. He faintly recalled being drawn to something against his
will. What was it? What...? </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He had to leave, find a dark place--a lonely,
secluded place, so he could let the tears that were drowning him inside
out. It had to some place far away; otherwise the whole Universe will
hear him weeping forever. </font></p></body></html>
