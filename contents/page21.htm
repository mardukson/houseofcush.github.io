<P>"I can go with you, you know?" </P>

<P>Marduk eyed the teenager warily as he pulled on his insular boots. He had tested the air and soil outside the ship for contamination and discovered it was far less poisonous than he would have guessed, but he still wanted to err on the side of caution. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He had not known a lot of females in this period of his existence. He recalled past lives when he had many women but those were times when his soul was young, innocent and uncontaminated with so much more pain and sorrow, than joy. Those were times when he laughed before he breathed, but his soul was far too old and experienced to the evils of this System to be as attractive to many females as it once was. But it was not lost on him that the girl thought of him as a potential mate. She was close to womanhood and eventually most people wanted to be with other people in the way of all natural things. </P>
<P>The teenaged boy was not her brother but the two seem to hate each other. The three little ones--two boys and a girl, -- will be more than 10 years reaching adulthood for the oldest of them. Even then, he had a feeling that they would have no appeal to Shu and Nut who has watched them grow up from infancy. Somehow, someway, he had to get the girl to like the boy. He never thought she wouldn't. It showed how much his long isolation from the world had crippled him socially. He thought male, female, under such abnormal conditions would automatically mean natural attraction. Maybe what he had to do was separate them. Familiarity bred contempt. Maybe that was the problem--the two needed space from each other. When he is sure it is safe to leave the ship permanently, he will build the boy his own house. </P>

<P>"It is not safe."</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> Marduk said to the young girl softly. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4>
<P>"Lord...?" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Marduk looked at her. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4>
<P>"You will never love me...like that...will you?" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"I am not for thee." </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4>
<P>"Then who will be?"</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> Tears glistened in her eyes. </P>
<P></P>
<P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>"Shu---" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Nut burst out in loud sobs and ran from the room just as the boy, Shu, was coming in. She brushed by him angrily. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>
<P>"Rogwart!"</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> Shu yelled after her. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>"What's the matter with her?"</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> He asked Marduk. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"She suffers for kindness." </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Shu sneered. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>"What she suffers for is beauty."</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> </P>
<P></P>
<P>Marduk placed his hand on the boy's shoulders and squared him. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"Hath thou learnt naught from my teaching? Hath I taught thee to despise thy wife? "</P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Shu's eyes got big. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>"Lord,<I> she</I> will not be my wife!" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Marduk's dark brown pupils danced with merriment. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"My son Shu, she<I> will</I> be thy wife." </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>"</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>Lord, I'm not marrying Nut."</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> The boy insisted. He folded his arms across his chest. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"Then who will thou marry?&#8221; </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>
<P>"I will marry Tefnut."</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> </P>
<P></P>
<P>The amusement in Marduk's eyes vanished. He stared at Shu until he squirmed. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>
<P>"He does not love her!"</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> Shu blurted. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>"And he treats her badly. I will treat her like a queen." </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Marduk looked at the boy. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>
<P>"Lord, I love her!" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Marduk said nothing. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>
<P>"I will not marry Rog faced, Nut!"</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> Shu yelled. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Marduk silently finished putting on his shiny, protective suit. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>
<P>"Lord...?" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Marduk turned to the boy. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>
<P>"She does not like me."</FONT><FONT size=4> Shu, said in a small voice. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
