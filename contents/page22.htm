<p>"AH CA ADOM MA SA!" </p>

<p></p>

<p>"AH CA ADOM MA SA!" </p>

<p></p>

<p>"AH CA ADOM MA SA!" </p>

<p></p>

<p>Marduk heard them long before he saw them. He froze in amazement to hear Atlan words coming from beyond the cliffs. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Could it be some of the Igigis, had survived the nuclear war? Impossible. How? </p>

<p></p>

<p>"AH CA ADOM MA SA.&#8221; </p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>What did they mean? "All come ADOM worship?" Adam? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Marduk listened more closely. Adam? Atom? Atum? </p>

<p></p>

<p>The only word he knew, in all the different languages of the world,
for "Creator" that even came close to what was being chanted is "Atum"
Some of the old people used to call the most high One, Atum--the one
source of all living things. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The big Magician listened even harder.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>

<p></p>

<p>AH CA ADOM MA SA! </p>

<p></p>

<p>Inconclusive, but it did sound enough Like "Adam," for him to go with that interpretation for the time being. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Adam, in the tone they were reflecting, meant "moon" in the
Atlantean tongue. In a slight change of tone and reflection the same
sound could mean a god. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Whatever they were saying these clearly weren't Atlanteans, because
no Atlantean would think of worshiping the moon. And too, their
phrasings were too disjointed for them to be Atlanteans. </p>

<p></p>

<p>There were Onanes people--meaning WoManoids, or in the likeness of
Onanes-- all over the earth when the great atrocity occurred. Some of
these people lived in such remote areas, the government of Atlan never
bothered to count or study them. Or, did they? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Could it be---no, not even these people would have survived such a
holocaust as that which destroyed Atlan unless--unless they were
specifically chosen in some way to survive. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"ALL COME GOD WORSHIP!" </p>

<p></p>

<p>If they were talking about worshiping the most high One, where did
they get the idea to gather together? Why would they "come" or travel
some place to worship the most high One, as if It is in some location
you can find? Where would they get such a concept? These people cannot
be Atlanteans and if they are, they must have been--- </p>

<p></p>

<p>The final puzzle to the entire mosaic hit Marduk like a ton of bricks. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Inanna had said that the Sumerian Sorcerers planned to set themselves up as "gods" to a whole new world of Beings! </p>

<p></p>

<p>Even before the chanting horde caught sight of him, and he of them,
Marduk knew what they were going to do. What he didn't know, and never
would have dreamed, as he watched them groveling, face to the ground
around him, was that they would all look exactly like the Igigis with
him except amazingly, they were half the size of the Atlantean
Cushites. They were clearly from the same stock as the Cushites with
him, but somehow--for some reason they had been bred down in size. It
wasn't hard to guess why. The Cushites of Atlan were big people--almost
as big as the Atlantean Elite. And each year a few of them were
becoming more and more rebellious against the system. This was why the
Sorcerers decided to destroy Atlan and start over. And he guessed the
small size of these people around him was meant to make them easier to
control and oppress. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"ATOM MA SA!" </p>

<p></p>

<p>"ATOM MA SA!" </p>

<p></p>

<p>"ATOM MA SA!" </p>

<p></p>

<p>Marduk sensed immediately that these little people had been
genetically tampered with to believe the first giant they saw were
god(s). And that giant wasn't supposed to be him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Will the crimes of the Sumerian Sorcerers ever find limit? </p>

<p></p>

<p>What they have done by altering the DNA, of secreted WoMans and
breeding these "Adamites"(moon worshippers), will disrupt the flow of
energy to and from the unknowable One, forever unless these little
people are either destroyed or some how deprogrammed. The first option
was not an option. Judging by their numbers--which he could see no end
to, as they streamed forward towards him--, these ones, have been
secretly breeding for a long time. They were clearly WoMan-beings--of
the people he had sworn to protect throughout many Ages and lifetimes.
But if they were born of the evil source, Itself, they were his Wards
now, and he had to find a way to preserve them, while at the same time
keep them from filling the universe with atoms for the Sumerian
Sorcerers and their Saurian manipulators to feast on. </p>

<p></p>

<p>How to de-program a brain that has been organically wired to exude
the exact opposite atoms from the atoms of oneness was a question he
had no answer for. The cursed Demons have committed an act even more
heinous than their destruction of Atlan. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Truly, the incomparable Thoth is a genius without peer. Recently, he recalled that in a past life, that this Thoth <i>was</i>
his blood brother. Way back then, his name was Azazel. He wasn't sure
if Thoth was connected to him in the same way in this lifetime. The
Sumerian Sorcerers had long, deliberately wove a web of confusion about
their blood relations to keep the Cushites confused and uncertain about
who they should ally themselves with during the endless struggle
between the Saurians and Womankind, for control of the Will of
creation. </p>

<p></p>

<p>What could be done now about Thoth's plot--if anything-- was out of
his hands. He had hoped to pioneer a whole new world of justice,
freedom and righteousness. Already he has been defeated and all that is
for him now, is damage control. The Sumerian Sorcerers seek to create a
world full of slaves who worship them so all atoms on the earth will
flow to them and empower them. Clearly the scheme as drawn up was
brilliant. From his intense magical research of his own mind and past
lives he discovered they have done this sort of thing before--many
times. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The reason they spent all the earth's resources on weapons of
destruction instead of spending more to colonize the billions of worlds
in an universe that was created for numberless Beings, whom were never
meant to die, is because they couldn't control an universe full of
atoms. All such atoms will flow to the unknowable One. So the Demons
limit all flesh to the sphere of the earth--raising and destroying one
civilization after another while they build themselves up with the
atoms such wholesale slaughter leaves anchorless. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The only hope to stop them, he saw dashed, in the earnest, ecstatic faces of the little people around him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Marduk looked up to the sky as the chanting around grew louder and more frenzied. </p>
