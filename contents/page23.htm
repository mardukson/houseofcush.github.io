<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big><font>T</font>wo years had passed
since he returned to the earth with a few remnants of the Cushites of
Atlan. There appeared no ill effects on the Cushites, or the Adamites,
from the nuclear devastation of the earth. That was one less thing to
worry about. His greatest task now--before the Sumerian Sorcerers
returned--was to prepare his Charges, mentally and spiritually, to
resist being enslaved. For that duty he relied heavily on the Cushites.
</big></p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>Some of them didn't like the responsibility.

</big></p>

<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>The boy Shu was sitting across from him.</big></p>

<big><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" size="4"><big><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><big><big><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><big><big><big><big>

</big></big></big></big><p style="font-family: serif;">"Lord, I'm tired
of trying to teach those dumb Apes! I tell them over and over that you
are not the unknowable One, and I am not the son of the Creator, but
all they do is shake their heads and grin. As soon as they think I'm
out of sight, it's "ATOM MA SA.&#8221; </p><big><big><big>

</big></big></big></font></big></big></font></big><font size="4">

<p><big><small>Marduk listened to the boy vent his anger and
frustration over not being able to win the girl. He was 18 years old
and all childishness had given sway to the call of nature.</small> </big></p><big>

</big></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><big><font color="#800080" size="4"><big><big>

</big></big></font></big></font></font><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" color="#800080"><font color="#800080"><p>"Hath thou tried romancing her?" </p>

</font></font><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" color="#ff0000"><font color="#ff0000">

<p>"What?" </p>

</font></font><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" color="#800080"><font color="#800080">

<p>"Nut, hath thou tried being nice to her?" </p>

</font></font><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" color="#ff0000"><font color="#ff0000">

<p>"Lord, I said nothing of Nut." </p>

</font></font></big>

<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>He wished
he could allow the boy to wed one of the many available female
Adamites. The boy Shu was nearly twice the size of the Adamites but he
did not think the mature ones would be hurt sexually in a union with
the boy. </big></p>



<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>There was
no difference between the Adamites and the Cushites save the boy's
brain was not organically altered by the Sumerian Sorcerers. The
Adamites and their fanatical inclination to worship outward, instead of
inward ,will leave themselves with no way to nurture their own hearts,
minds and consciences. There had to be a balance to them as the WoMans,
grew in numbers on the earth. The boy Shu and the girl, Nut, were the
keys to that balance. <br>
</big></p>
<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>He recalled
when the Igigis used to be WoManbeings, and how they were denigrated by
a magical renaming to being called Omans, which means beasts. Now they
were denigrated again by being called Igigis. He hated using the name
because he knew of the evil sorcery that was performed behind the
naming, but as a Sorcerer, he knew he could not change the name. Once a
people accept a naming, only they can change it, only they can find
their way back to their true selves. For him to help them will
accomplish nothing and would do more damage than good because a people
can't be told who they are, they have to discover who they are. </big></p>




<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>Marduk asked of Shu:<font color="#800080"><font color="#800080"> "Where is thy wife?" </font></font></big></p>



<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>The boy's countenance distorted with rage </big></p>


<big><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" color="#ff0000"><font color="#ff0000">

<p>"She is with that Ape again! Lord she pretends that she is teaching
them but she spends all her time behind rocks with that stupid pygmy,
Geb!" </p>

</font></font></big>

<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>The one
thing he was afraid of. He had been so busy working with the Adamites,
teaching them how to build houses and plant fields, he had neglected
the Cushites. The boy Shu was as close to him as ever. He could barely
recall the last time he talked to Nut, Tefnut, Djhuty, or the three
children. </big></p>


<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>He had been
asking a lot of all of them, which may be why they avoided him. Maybe
he had no place trying to keep the two groups of adult WoMans from one
another, sexually. After all, the race to populate the earth was
already lost. The Adamites will fill the world. Shu, Nut and the other
Cushites will now be, disappointedly, limited to birthing a remnant of
teachers and Prophets. Their seed will not fill the earth with atoms
but they are the ones who have to de-program the Adamites. This was the
only remaining hope. Or another world of atoms and its riches will fall
to the Saurians and their pawns. </big></p>




<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>He will no
longer forbid Djhuty and Tefnut, whom the boy says grows more estranged
from each other every day. But Nut is for Shu. There was no other
choice. </big></p>


<big><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" color="#800080"><font color="#800080">

<p>"My son Shu, thy must win the heart of thy wife. To do this, thy
must first master thy temper and thy callous tongue. If thou will
attract a light like Nut, thou cannot glow with the molecules of
demons. "</p></font></font></big>

<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>Shu dropped his head in acknowledgment of the rebuke. </big></p>



<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>Marduk laid a hand on Shu's shoulder. <font color="#800080"><font color="#800080">"Now go get Nut, I know--" </font></font></big></p>



<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>Shu ducked under Marduk's arm. </big></p>


<big><font style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" color="#ff0000"><font color="#ff0000">

<p>"Father, Nut is in love with Geb! Don't you understand? She does not want me!" </p>

</font></font></big>

<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>Marduk roared.<font color="#800080"><font color="#800080"> "She cannot be with Geb! Ye, go find Nut and bring her to me!" </font></font></big></p>



<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><big>Shu had
never seen the Lord angry, or heard his voice raised. The experience
was frightening. He backed away before turning and running to find Nut.
