<p>He heard them before he saw them. The same sounds he heard when
Tefnut used to come at night into the room of Djhuty. The same sounds
he had spent four years wishing he could make with Tefnut. He wanted
Nut because she was all the Lord says he can have. But he was in love
with Tefnut. </p>

<p></p>

<p>When he saw Nut, naked, sitting on top of Geb, it was fear more than
Jealousy that drove him when he dragged her away from the Adamite. All
he could think about was Nut being big with Geb's child. The Lord will
explode with anger. He had seen a hint of that anger. He did want to
see it again. </p>

</font></font><p><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4">"What are you doing?"</font></font><font size="4"> Nut screamed. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Shu shoved her to the ground. Out of the side of his
eye he saw Geb charging at him. For an Adamite he was grossly
over-sized, about the same weight as he, and less than a head shorter. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">He turned and met Geb with a hard, vicious knee,
forgetting that to Geb, he was a god, and the young Adamite was
probably running to Nut, -- not to attack him. He was scared and mad.
The Lord told Nut, and he told Geb, they were not for each other. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The Lord said to bring Nut to him but she clung to
Geb so tight and was crying so piteously, he didn't have the heart to
do anything else to the couple. Besides, unless the deed was already
done, the Lord didn't have to worry about Geb fathering children on Nut
anymore. </font></p></body></html>
