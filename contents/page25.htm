<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Ki wondered if Nergal was that stupid or if he was just trying to
start a conversation. She hated his loud voice so most of the time they
spent together trying to learn to be Captains of Thoth's ship was in
silence. She just did not want to talk to him. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

<p>"Well, if it was me, we'd know." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Ki eyed Nergal warily. The lecherous gleam in his eyes normally
would have stoked her own lust. She never turned down a chance to
copulate but she was too preoccupied to feel amorous.<br>
 </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">

<p>"Why don't thou go unto thy Abds? I have work to do." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Nergal shrugged and retracted his huge phallus. </p>

</font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Obviously."</font></font><font size="4"> Ki said without looking up from the papers before her. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">A sudden flicker of light caught his attention and
Nergal looked into the small monitor mounted on the wall above Ki's
head. A scene on earth showed Djhuty, alone, in a wide barren area. He
had a small, squirming animal tied to a log. Nergal watched him
mumbling something before taking a knife and slitting the animal's
throat. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">The big Sorcerer bellowed. Ki cringed as if a church bell had towed right up against her ear. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Ibis! Thou sonavawitch!"</font></font><font size="4"> Nergal crowed with glee. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Ki looked up at the screen. A smile slowly spread
across her face. Scales broke out all over her soft, unblemished skin
as she watch Djhuty, set the animal on fire. She turned to Nergal, who
was standing over her shoulder and licked his chest. Instants later she
was on top of Nergal, her 10 foot long green, Saurian form straddling,
riding the big Ty in wild abandon. </font></p></body></html>
