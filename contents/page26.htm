<p>It was not the first time he had performed a sacrifice. He was the
witch, Inanna's, high Priest. She had released him before he left with
the Lord and he never felt the desire to engage in black magic until
today. </p>

<p>The Lord will burn him with the blue fire if he found out what he
had done this day, but he could not help it. It was as if some Lord was
calling him, driving him against his will to worship. He did not want
to do it. He should not have hated the woman. That's why he did this
thing today. He was a Sorceress' Priest. He knew better than to flare
his atoms up like that. Some Lord had sensed him. Now he has done this
terrible thing. The big Lord will smite him with the blue fire. </p>

<p>Djhuty dug at the sand like a wild animal as he tried to bury the evidence of his crime. </p>

<p>The Adamite, Geb, stood watching him. He had seen the entire ritual.
Tears still streaked his face but what he had witnessed comforted him
in a way he did not know-- for a reason he did not understand. He will
never be inside a woman again and until now, he thought there was
nothing he'd ever be able to do about it. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He knew even as he watched the strange god scrambling about like a runbit, the god would be back to do what he did again. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He knew because he was sure the god had to be feeling the same something he felt. </p></font></body></html>
