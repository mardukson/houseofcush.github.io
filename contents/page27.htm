</font></font><p><font color="#808040" size="4"><font color="#808040" size="4">"So you like spying on people, eh boy?"</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Before he could turn his head towards the voice that
spoke to him, the young Adamite was grabbed by the back of the neck and
roughly hoisted to his feet. As he was violently shoved to the ground,
he briefly glimpsed the face of his attacker. It was the strange god he
had only moments before watch enter into the cave far below the cliff
where he had perched himself to spy undetected. The last thing Geb saw
before he passed out, was the strange god reaching into a pouch. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Djhuty struggled to lift the Adamite across his
shoulders. If it wasn't for the mixture of adrenaline and fear, he
wouldn't have been able to lift the boy at all--much less carry him
down the cliff. For an Adamite he was very large--as big as an
undersized Igigi adult male. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">He had never before taken such a grave risk. He never
sacrificed children or any people at all, because his daughter Nut
never stopped spying and reporting on him. Even the small animals he
slaughtered, he had to stink up his cave with, because he couldn't let
her or her spies witness the ritual. Back in Atlantis she would never
have dared interfere with his holy work. Back in Atlantis, he would
have condemned her before the Lords and tied <i>her</i> to his Altar.
But here in this new earth, the big Lord ruled, and he knew Marduk
would kill him for this, if he found out, but the god inside his head
was insistent that he kidnap this boy. He didn't know why this
particular Adamite except maybe his unusual appearance. The boy was
big, but he had other striking features that marked him apart from
everyone else on this new earth. Nothing that was so rare back in
Atlan, but among the Adamites, his light skin and yellow hair was
duplicated in none other. He had the same flat facial features as
everyone else but the curls of his hair were not tightly knitted
against his scalp, but big, round and soft. There was plenty of his
type in Atlantis after the Lords started letting the Igigi women they
impregnated live. One would think the boy was some Lord's son except no
god's son was ever so cowardly, accommodating and runty. They were all
mighty men like Marduk. The boy's white skin marked him as a son of the
Saurian Caudipteryx house. Maybe the big Adamite <i>was</i> the son of
a Lord--the same god that has entered his head, driving him crazy with
his constant demands. Maybe the Nomelan's small size just means his
Mother is an Adamite. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Djhuty finally got the boy down off the cliff. A
momentary wave of pure fear hit him, and he looked around frantically.
Then he remembered that his daughter was big with child and he had seen
no inkling of her or her spies in weeks. He gathered himself and
hurried the Adamite inside the cave. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">As he entered with he boy draped across his
shoulders;the sickening stench of Hatebit piss still assaulted his
heightened senses despite the fact that he had driven all the rodents
out long ago. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He had been living inside the cave for years. Still,
the only furniture in the dank, musty place was a halfcocked seating
apparatus intended to be a chair and a six foot long metal table he had
secreted away when Marduk had his ship cannibalized to aid as a
prototype for the space program. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In ten minutes he had the boy securely strapped to
the table. He looked around but there was not nearly enough wood inside
the cave to do the sacrifice with such a big creature. This was
insanity! He should have never hated the woman. Now some god has sensed
and entered into him. The god was going to kill him. He knew it--knew
his type. He would use him and then kill him, or make him do things
that will cause him to get himself killed. He needed more wood. The god
was loud inside his head now, threatening, screaming. He looked at the
Adamite, and satisfied himself that the boy could not get loose. He
left the cave to find more wood so he could satisfy and quiet the
screaming god inside his head. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Geb awakened and nearly fainted again when he
discovered he was bound to the table exactly like he had seen the
strange god do to many other animals. He never knew he had it in him,
and if it wasn't for fear he never would have found out;with one
adrenaline powered motion, he snapped the ropes binding his chest and
arms as if they were needle thread. He sat up and began to work
frantically at the other bonds. He had just freed himself completely
when at that very moment the strange god returned. Geb looked at him,
frozen like a cornered runbit. The strange god looked at Geb,
initially, equally motionless. Then suddenly the strange god leapt, a
wide, shimmering blade appearing in his fist as if it materialized from
thin air. Instinct alone is what got Geb moving and instinct is far
swifter than deliberation. When Djhuty plunged the knife, all that was
there for him to hit was metal table. Geb was already up and sprinting
for the cave entrance. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Djhuty screeched in agony. The ringing halt of the
blade's momentum caused his tight grip to slide down across metal so
sharp, it cut through bone as easily as it did through skin. Blood
spurted. Half of Djhuty&#8217;s hand remained part of the rest of his body by
a string of skin. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Geb was at the cave's entrance, when he ran into what
felt like a rock wall--an invisible rock wall. The last thing he heard
before he was once again separated from his consciousness was the
strange god screaming like a Tonbig, his voice too deep and guttural to
have come from the strange, old god. </font></p></body></html>
