<p></p>

<p>Marduk paced the floor with all kinds of catastrophic scenarios
racing through his mind as he waited for Shu to return with Nut. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The boy said the girl spent all her time behind rocks with Geb. He
had explained to the two young adults why they couldn't be together
sexually. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He thought that they understood. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Adamites and Igigis will become one people, but first he had to
counter the scheme of the Sorcerers by teaching the Adamites that the
only way to worship the unknowable One, is to keep one's atoms flowing
with the force of the source of all that is good. The only way to do
that was by constant self examination--constant vigilance over one's
own thoughts and deeds. To worship outside one's self, is to neglect
one's own atoms, leaving them vulnerable to stronger magnets, which
seek relentlessly to gain the atoms of all living things. This is what
the Sorcerers have conspired to do to yet another world of beings. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He still has not discovered who was writing these religious texts
the boy Shu had been bringing to him. No one seemed to know where they
are coming from, but he recognized the scribbling of Sorcerers when he
saw them. Some Magician was writing the ritualistic dribble, which
meant somebody was taking dictation from disembodied Saurians, which
meant somebody on this new earth was performing black magic and the
Adamites were already falling for an age old trick--a tried and proven
instrument of death, misery and destruction for the WoMan race. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Though he knew their brains were organically infused with some sort
of DNA, microchips, that compelled them, it still amazed him how
thoroughly convinced the Adamites remained that he was the Atum, even
after he himself has told them over and over again it was not so. </p>

<p></p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end--Atlan, all over again. He had
hoped to induce the Cushites and Adamites to develop their natural
telepathic abilities by exercising their memories and brain waves. They
were but a few, with an entire universe to populate. They had no need
of myths and written instructions on how to be true to their natures
because they yet had no history. They will all experience history as it
happens together and they will remember and pass it on. The last thing
that they needed was somebody interpreting for them events they will
see with their own eyes. They will soon forget how to reason and
analyze events for themselves and they will become slaves to the lie
and the Authors of the lie. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He knew the chance for the full realization of his dream was lost
when the Adamites first called him, "Adom." Even so, he still held on
to the hope that he could de-program the Adamites by showing them that
truth was in the reality of their senses, not in the written word. He
had seen in Atlan how the most evil, asinine scribbling had held sway
over the most evident of truths. He had witnessed how the power of the
written word had caused all Atlanteans to become cold robots with no
ability to see, feel, or sense the universe, or the other atoms or life
around them. They had lost all their senses to atrophy, as the serpent
Ki lost her muscles. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The method, about this whole attempt to yet again, enslave and
destroy another opportunity for a mass of Beings to find paradise and
eternal life, on earth and beyond, is an old one. It had Thoth's
signature all over it. It stank with the rankness and manipulations of
the dead Ones. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Their agent Thoth was the first to "interpret" language for the
Atlanteans too. Before the Atlantean civilization, it was Onanes who
gave the people their words and meanings. After him, other Sorcerers
schemed to create the world's reality by interpreting words and writing
prophecy. And they always made the claim to be the unknowable One, or
to be speaking for the unknowable One. But Marduk knew they were just
speaking for the dead Ones, and their own lusts and glory. </p>

<p></p>

<p>This meant that the Sorcerers were here on earth. But how? He had
destroyed their capability to develop a method of space travel for at
least 10,000 years. The Sorcerers cannot be on earth. So who were
giving the Adamites these ritual texts? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Beloved Inanna had come to him again last night. She kept trying to
remind him of their connection by calling him Osiris. The dreams were
so vivid and real, she may as well have been physically lying beside
him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If Inanna,--though she were not truly present--was so effectively
real to him, could it be some Sorcerer was also projecting the same
false reality unto one of the Cushites, or Adamites? Could it be Thoth
was using one of them, as Inanna used his body and emotions to keep him
bound to her? If so, whom? <br>
</p>
<p>But no Cushite or Adamite was sealed as he was. He sealed himself to
Inanna of his own free will, and too, being a Sorcerer, his atoms
flared greatly, so it should be no surprise that the Sorceress could
project herself unto him. What Cushite, or Adamite, had such atoms as
his--that a Sorcerer could sense him/her, from so far away? Only the
practice of black magic, in a willful attempt to contact the Sorcerers
could remotely flare up the atoms of any being here on earth--besides
he, that much. True, any strong emotion, besides unselfish love, could
draw a Sorcerer's attention when they are close. But the Sorcerers are
physically on another world for now. </p>


<p></p>

<p>If Thoth was truly here in atoms, then some one was practicing black
magic. But who? Who would dare? And why had he not sensed such evil? It
could not be the Adamites. He spent much time among them teaching and
showing them how to apply the technologies of Atlan that were good and
beneficial. He sensed no evil in them. Besides, they were too happy to
attract a demon's attention. Also, they worshiped him with a faith and
stubbornness that was infuriating. Such were their devotion to him they
were killing him in the flesh before his time by flaring his atoms up
so that his power grew every day. They will explode him one day but he
had much work to do before that time. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But the Adamites were also worshiping and empowering... </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Cushites. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But that is ridiculous. Who of his most beloved children would so betray the universe? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Shu...? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Nonsense. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Nut...? </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Cushites are all becoming like him--more than their allotted
atoms--through no fault of their own. Nut may have resentment against
him, and her passionate love for Geb indeed flares up her atoms, but
the girl is light. She would not practice black magic to attract a
demon's attention. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Tefnut...? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Ridiculous. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Djhuty...? </p>

<p></p>

<p>The former high Priest is about as evil as a WoMan-being can get,
but the beloved Isis had released him. He had studied the shifty-eyed
sneak thoroughly before they left the moon. It raised suspicion in him
that Inanna would try to force such a criminal upon him. He studied
Djhuty, sensed no evil atoms flaring, and decided to trust Inanna for
sake of all she had already done and risked. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The three children were beyond thoughts of suspicion. They were growing up to be true lights of the most high One. </p>

<p>The Adamites were empowering the Cushites by worshiping them as the
children of "god." He had not seen Djhuty in a while. He thought
nothing of it because all the Igigis, except the boy Shu were avoiding
him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>It is time to call an audience with them all--especially the former high Priest. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Why did Shu wait so long to tell him that Nut and Geb were still
seeing each other in seclusion? Hopefully, they had not been sexually
intimate. He warned them against it. He forbade it! </p>

<p></p>

<p>If the unacceptable has happened, what can he do? He could not kill
Nut's unborn child. Yet, any Children born from a union between the
Cushites, and Adamites will add a dimension to the struggle to stop the
Sumerian Sorcerers that will effectively render it a hopeless cause. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If he is god, in the eyes of the Adamites, and the Cushites are the
children of god, any offspring born to Nut and Geb will be Demigods, to
the Adamites, who because of their numerical superiority are destined
to fill most of the earth. Such Demi-gods will have a compulsion to
worship themselves which the Cushites don&#8217;t have. Add that to the fact
that the Adamites will also worship them, it's inevitable that the
world will become filled with Sorcerers and black magicians--all
flaring up their atoms and giving homes to the atoms of the Sumerian
Sorcerers and their disembodied Saurian masters. If this happens, the
Sumerian Sorcerers will return to an earth filled with worshipers and
allies. And the Saurians will openly possess, walk and rule among men
and beasts again. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Nut cannot have Geb's child! </p>

<p></p>

<p>He should have already forced the girl to wed Shu. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He was too easily blinded and led by those he loved. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But it is not Nut's fault. She is a young girl in love. The blame is
his, because he should have known that given the chance she would act
in the natural way of most living things. He had done it enough himself
with the witch, Inanna. </p>

<p></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Where is Shu with the girl?</span> </p>

<p></p>

<p>Marduk glanced at the time piece on his wrist, abandoning his thoughts just as Shu came into his presence. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He looked, but did not see the girl. </p>

<p></p>

<p>In the redness and fear he saw in Shu's eyes, he knew his senses were right. </p>

<p>"Father, she was on him. I didn't mean to but I-- </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">
