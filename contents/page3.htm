<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Osiris." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She said, teasingly. <br><br>He tilted his head up towards her voice and tried to concentrate. He couldn't recall anything else but he did remember her. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">Inanna</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">. Her name is<span style="color: rgb(255, 153, 255);"> <span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">I</span></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">nanna.</span> <br><br>He
was back from the dead, alright. At least he thought he was. He also
thought he was awake. That was before he tried to think, and his mind
tried to block his recall. He allowed it the temporary respite. But
even as he closed his eyes to reality for a little while longer, he
knew that sooner or later he would have to wake up and face what mindblowing thing had happened to him. <br><br>A day later he bolted upright in
bed. A horrible thought abruptly struck him. He reached up and touched
his face. The skin was still there, but there was a rough beard that
told him he must have been unconscious for at least three days.
Suddenly it dawned on him that he could not see. He reached up to
examine his eyes and discovered they had been bandaged. Despite the
mental block, he began to concentrate--to try to remember what happened
to him, where he was, and how he got here. His senses told him
immediately that he was at home in his own space. The wit--Inanna, must
have brought him here. <br><br>Inanna. Did she bring him back to
life? Did the witch call him back from the void? He remembered hearing
her crying out to him as he passed into the black of eternal silence.
She called him Osiris--one who rises from the dead. It was Sorcery. A
naming. She had named him back to the living side of the divide between
life and death, of the flesh. <br><br>Suddenly, breathtakingly, he remembered something else. <br><br>He
reached up and snatched the bandages from his eyes. He still could not
see, but that was not what brought the sting of salt to his damaged
orbs, or the sobs of anguish from his trembling lips. <br><br>She
must've heard his cries, because she came rushing to his side. He felt
her presence and instantly fire welled up within him. He didn't know
that she was still in his space. He had not sensed her. Surprise,
caused the pure, unadulterated substance of her, to assault his senses.
His love for her masked her true essence. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Thou should not have taken these off</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She touched him as she replaced the bandages, and he barely staved off the urge to engage her. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Marduk,"</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> her voice was pure pain </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Would thou, truly?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Ye knew! Thou were a part of it all" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Her beautiful, ebon face crumbled. She stumbled, as if the coldness in his tone had plunged like a dagger into her heart. <br><br>She fell/threw herself upon him </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Slay me Marduk! Only for the sake of our love and all&nbsp; that I have risked for thee, allow me to expire in thy arms." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">"<i>Slay her?</i>" The woman spoke energy very carelessly, and it was hard enough for him as it was, not to grab her neck. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Think Thou I, of the same cloth as the monsters who will plot to destroy a world?" </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He shoved her off him with violence he had not intended. <br><br>She
fell to the floor. When she spoke next, he never heard a voice more
disconsolate, or sensed an essence-- that was not dying,--more faint. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Thou hath slain me."</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> She said, and he knew it was truth. <br><br>How
could he kill her and not put an end to himself? Living without half
his soul would be far harder than living without his eyes or his arms
and legs. <br><br>It was more weakness than he could afford that gave life to his next words. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Live witch. If it is my love that will resurrect thee, be thou unto me, now, and forever hence, Isis." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She scrambled to her feet and swayed above him. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Thy riddling suspends me, Marduk! Tell me thy heart!" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">He reached up and pulled her down to him. His big hands circled her slender neck. He squeezed. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Doth this tell thee my heart?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"No." </font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She
did not move or resist. Her voice was so soft and accepting, for a
moment he thought it might do her a kindness to twist her head. <br><br>His
hands relaxed and moved up, caressed her smooth cheeks. He tilted up
his head and kissed her, lightly first, and then hard and deep. <br><br>He finally let her go. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Doth that tell thee my heart?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Tears were in her big brown eyes-- brown eyes that were, moments ago, as green as a daggercat's. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Yes."</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">
She answered happily. She stood there, and he could tell that she
desperately wanted a look from him, maybe a gesture. He looked at her
for the first time with eyes of what <i>he</i> really wanted. She
gasped; an involuntary sound that resounded like a million years of
desperation. She leaned over him and reached for his center. <br><br>He embraced her and in their nakedness they became one. <br><br>Hours later, when he thought she was asleep and he would never know the peaceful bliss of it again, she spoke: </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Marduk, why do the triumph of thy love for me, over thy hatred for me, rename me?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Being a Sorceress she knew the significance of names. A name always had a deeper purpose for a Magician than just a title. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Because thy love has called me back from the wages of my sins." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Then I am thy wife?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Doth thy know me?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She propped herself up on an elbow and stared into his face. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Thou remember?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Doth thee?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She nodded. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"When?"</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> He asked. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"When I thought thou were..."</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> She stopped. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"When did thou remember?"</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"From the moment I sensed thy essence" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"I'm so sorry."</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> &nbsp;Tears rolled warm down his bare chest.</font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman"> "Thou will always despise me?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Shalt I love evil? What thou hath done to the Cushites of Atlan shall stain thee forever." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She
turned away from him. &nbsp;Her loud sobs ended abruptly, as if she had
instantly turned into a different &nbsp;person. She whispered something
so softly he barely heard it. What he thought he heard her say once
again, was, </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"slay me."</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> <br><br>He laid his hand on her shoulder and coerced her to turn again towards him. His tone was impassioned. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Why
beloved? Surely thou art no gold hungry, hound of the perverted. What
strong desire? For what gain, bindeth thou, thy soul to the legions of
the hell bound? " </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Marduk, think thou of the tormented history of the children of the abds. Would thou ask <span style="font-style: italic;">them </span>why, twenty years hence? Or would thy know?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Tears again stung the big Magician's eyes. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"If I had no other reason, I shall crush them all for little Inanna." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"No <i>Milord</i>,
Inanna belongs to them. But Isis belongs to thee. Struggle not for
Inanna Marduk, but Isis will forever be faithful, good, and true to
love and righteousness." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">Marduk, the reluctant Sorcerer stiffened in his bones and he felt blood speed to his heart. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Why hath thou spoken magic? Did thou misspeak a word?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Ye know I hath not." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"The unknowable One hath visited me." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"I know." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"But how?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Because when they speak thy name in the Guild, strong Sorcerers tremble and weak Sorcerers gnash their teeth." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"It
is urgent then that I leave this place now, for they hath given me up.
But there are things I have to do first. Will ye help me?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"I have already commanded my abds....Marduk, take them with thee."</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"I shall secure all the surviving Cushites of course." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Please,
Marduk. Do not vex me with worthless speech. I lose too much. My abds
will be waiting for thee and ready to go at a moment's notice. They
have murdered themselves at my command unless ye get them away before
it is discovered. To try to save all the Igigis, is to doom them all." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"But they are all that is left of the WoMans of Atlan. &nbsp;I cannot---" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Marduk,
I have released my Igigis, but the others are bound to the Guild. They
will rise up against thee. Risk all, not for the toadies, but ye have
been ordained on behalf of an Universe. There are plans,
Milord--powerful magic being invoked...words being spoken that will
condemn the whole earth to an eternity of sorrow and pain. It is beyond
the scope of what even ye can imagine. I have instructed my Igigis to
counter speech with speech but thou are in a losing race Marduk." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Beloved
Inanna, that thou will betray such secrets; that thou will do such
works against thy own security, surely condemns my measure of thy aura
as a lie." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"No Milord, never doubt thy sense, for it is thy strength and shield. One who speaks to thee now is Isis, not Inanna." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Then thou cannot be released?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"I will be released after thou defeat me." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Ye, beloved?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"I am they and I am thee." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"What will they do to thee when they discover what thou hath done?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"They
will do naught to me because a house divided cannot stand. They know
that their only hope to survive ye is to stand as one." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Doth
thou even now seek to deceive me? I have seen thee devour amongst thy
toadies, one against the other. Thou are restricted by naught in what
thy do to deceive." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">'Tis
true Marduk, with the lesser people, but not amongst the Sorcerers of
Sumeria. They--we--hate one another but we know we need to stand united
if we are not to perish by the destiny of the son of the sun. </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"It is my destiny to break thee in two." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Then it is mine to be broken." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Give thou, then, the victory unto me before there is even a battle?" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"There
can be no battle against the great Will of creation--only the
delusional flailing of fools who have long lost all perception of
reality. Fools, who in their psychoses believe moments to be Ages and
themselves to be long-lived, when the unknowable One, has never yet
blinked an eye and seen them." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">"Isis---" </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"--Turn
thou, away from me now, Marduk. They call and I must go to them. When
next we meet it shall be in battle. But hearten beloved, because the
unknowable One has been merciful. In the end, when all evil lay broken
to pieces at thy feet, I shall be made whole again in oneness with the
son of all that is Just. In the end, thou will turn again to me. This
is the strength that allows me to send thee on thy way, even tho' with
thee goes all that is of me that is not now loathsome to my soul." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman">First
tell me why hath I never seen thee before three weeks ago? Thou sit
among the Sorcerers like thy had been on council forever." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She stopped moving away and turned to him. </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">"Thou
hath not seen me before because I am half Igigi. I was born to an abd,
and raised by one. Because I could not hide my powers as a child, my
high born father hath claimed me. I have long been among the Sorcerers
but they kept me out of sight because I am a last Generation Halfling.
Today, they are afraid and desperate because of thee and thou Father's
love for thee. They need me, and so they no longer ostracize me." </font><br>
<br>
<font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman">She finished answering his question and took one last, long look at him. &nbsp;Then she turned and exited his presence. <br><br>He watched her leave, hoping with all his might that she was right in all she predicted. <br><br>He
knew they were pure evil. &nbsp;He knew they were depraved. He knew
they were without consciences and after the destruction of Atlan he now
know&nbsp; they are insane. But... <br><br>The Atlantean word for the
most high One is "Atom," or "Atum." Surely, not even the diseased minds
of the Sumerian Sorcerers could be so delusional as to think they could
aim their black magic at the very seat of the apex of creation.
Incredulous! But even though the thought of their &nbsp;hubris struck
him as insanely incredulous, he knew </font><font class="fsx06" color="#ff00ff" face="Times New Roman">SHE</font><font class="fsx06" face="Times New Roman"> did not lie. They truly intended to use black magic to challenge creation. <br><br>They
plan to set themselves up as "gods" and enslave the entire universe to
their version of reality; a reality that makes war, genocide,
starvation, oppression, perversion, elitism, WoMan sacrifice, and
slavery the normality, when it is an aberration that all creation would
vomit out of Itself if the distortion induced by black magic did not
drug the collective psyche, rendering it not only incapable of hating
the wrong, the unjust, the abomination--but actually developing a lust
for every iniquity. <br><br>They seek to create anew, their world
reality-- where the Tyrant is worshiped as a hero, and the destroyers
are glorified as Saviors. A world where slaughter raises up Empires,
and the bloody sacrifice of living creatures, multiplies riches. A
world where the divide is loved and unity is hated; where to do good is
derided as weakness and to do evil is praised as strength. A world
where to respect, love and be kind to all is despised, and to
denigrate, debase, and harden the heart to the poor and powerless is
lauded. <br><br>This is the same reality they had created in Atlantis,
and now that they have destroyed Atlan, they seek to mold again the
great will of creation after the designs of their own monstrous hearts.
<br><br>But if they will be gods, he will be avenging angel; if they
will be day, he will be night. And he will break them on every hill and
in every valley. &nbsp;Into every dark, hidden, crevice he shall pursue
them. When they overturn a stone he shall overturn a pebble. When they
speak a curse, he shall speak a blessing. When they create a slave he
shall create a free man. And when they lay low a woman he shall raise
one up.<br><br>So swear he, the one chosen by the most high One, because he has loathed injustice. <br><br>He is Marduk. <br><br></font></big>
