<p>From a distant cliff, across from Marduk and Nut, Djhuty spied in
secrecy. He had been watching his daughter, trying to feed off her
misery when Marduk showed up. When the girl screamed at the Lord, his
first inclination was to turn and flee--run like a flatten-eared
doostreak, chasing the wind. But when no blue streak of death followed
the girl's unthinkable impertinence, he not only held his spot, his
fear of Marduk kept running, and in its place a contempt for the
softness he saw in the big Lord rose up in Djhuty that left him hating
with a passion that which he had lived in fear of for so long. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He had never hated the witch Inanna and the other Lords;even when
they raped and tortured him as a child, even when they ordered him to
torture and sacrifice his own seed on the altar--he never hated them.
Even after he watched them destroy the minds, bodies, and souls of
Igigi after Igigi--his own people-- he did not hate them. He had loved
them, because he knew they hated and despised him and would kill him in
an instant. Despite this, they let him live and prosper, and he loved
them for it. He loved them because they were strong, ruthless, and
predictable. There was comfort in knowing your place in the universe,
and there was freedom in being a slave. No slave had to think, or
ponder, or take responsibility for his thoughts or deeds. There were
too many tortures, murders, rapes, and other evils in his past for him
to suddenly be in the position to be able to defy the Lords without
dire consequences. The guilt is their's--not his, and he will not be
freed by them; he will not allow them to offer him options. He will not
accept their guilt. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He had long resented the kindness the big Lord extended toward all
the Igigis and Adamites. He resented that even though Lord Marduk had
no woman, he did not call for females, or children. He resented that
though all the Adamites worshiped him, Baal Marduk did not take
advantage of his experience and demand the sacrifice. He resented the
sudden power the woman gained over him because the big Lord stuck his
nose into how a slave treated another slave. He resented that the big
Lord allowed the Adamites and Cushites to walk straight and to speak
without trembling. He resented it, but he never hated the big Lord
until now. Fear kept his resentment cautious and impotent. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Today he has seen there is nothing to fear. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Djhuty left off from spying on Marduk and Nut. He went to search for
a runbit, but even at that moment he knew he would be soon kidnapping
children. </p></font></body></html>
