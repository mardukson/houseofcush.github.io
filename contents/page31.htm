<P>Marduk sensed what the girl's rage was asking for, but as much as he wanted to soothe her he could not give it to her. He could not let her be with Geb. </P>

<P>"Daughter thou will marry Shu or wait until Horus is of age." </P>

<P>A sudden evil that flared her aura made him instinctly want to engage her. </P>

<P>"I will be with Geb and I will bear his seed! I don't care about your precious universe, or what happens to you or any one else! You can not stop me! When I loved you, you--" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Nut stopped in mid sentence. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Marduk watched her whole body trembling with unanchored atoms. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"I am a long lived Sorcerer, Daughter. Thou art not for my kind" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Nut looked up. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4>
<P>"I have been with your kind before. You could have loved me! I would have given your seed birth into the world! " </P>

<P>"Thou would have birthed a Demon" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>True anguish made the aura of evil imperceptible in the girl and Marduk felt love rise up in him for her. </P>

<P>"No, Lord. How could your child be evil?"</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> She looked like she wanted to come to him. He stiffened and she retreated. </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"The child of a sorcerer will worship himself, and all the Adamites will worship him. I have told thee what this kind of perverted concentrating of atoms will do to the flow of energy to the one source." </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4>
<P>"But Lord you are good. What evil can come from you?" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
<P>"There is naught that is good in the universe but the unknowable One. It is the source of all that is pure and It alone, is incorruptible" </P>

<P>A cawing bird flew high above the two figures and stopped, its wings flapping slowly. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Both Marduk and Nut looked up at the same time. The bird flew away and the two returned attention to each other. </P>

<P>"So will thou be Shu's betrothed?" </P>

<P>"I will not!"</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> Nut ripped her covering, exposing all her flesh. </FONT><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4><FONT color=#0080c0 size=4>"Lord, please. I never loved Geb." </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Marduk raised his hands and spoke words Nut did not understand. </P>
<P></P>
<P>She felt the chill upon her exposed body suddenly change to cozy warmth. She looked at herself and she was covered from head to toe--including her face. While she stood in open mouthed surprise, Marduk said to her; </P>
<P></P></FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>
