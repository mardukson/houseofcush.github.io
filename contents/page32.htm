<p>Horus lay on his bedding unable to sleep, yet again. He missed being
around Marduk. But the Lord never had time for him any more. Every time
he went to talk to the Lord, Shu was in the way. He did not know how to
talk to the Lord when people were around, and he wished Shu would
disappear. </p>

<p></p>

<p>At the age of 12 years, he was next to the youngest of the three children that escaped with Marduk from the moon. </p>

<p>The Lord liked Shu better, but one day the Lord will notice him
because he will do more than Shu. He will be better than Shu. He loved
the Lord more than anyone and he will help the Lord defeat the
Sorcerers. When he grows up he will destroy all the enemies of the
Lord. </p></font></body></html>
