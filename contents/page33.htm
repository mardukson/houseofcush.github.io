<p></p>

<p>Marduk, sat, so lost in his thoughts that it was only after Tefnut
had given up and had knocked one last hopeful time, that he heard the
pounding on his door. She had reluctantly turned, when she finally
heard him respond. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Come in." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk turned toward the door as it slowly opened. It annoyed him
more than ever, when she appeared, eyes cast down to the floor like a
slave, her body as wound and tense as that of a terrified runbit. She
made him feel like a Monster and he resented the injustice of the
assault. </p>

<p>What more could he do? How long is it going to take for the older
Cushites to relate to him the way he deserved? He has never harmed them
and has for nearly ten years now, gone out of his way to instill in
them that he will never hurt them, still-- and this woman was the
worst--they tiptoe around him like he was some kind of Demon ...the
same Demons that had scarred them in Atlantis. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"What is it daughter?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>He was in no mood to temper his tone from his feelings at that
moment, which to his dismay only served to cower her more. Her mouth
opened and initially no sound came forth. Then she began to stutter in
an incoherent babble. He knew how sensitive the Cushites were to the
moods and tones of the Atlantean Elite's voices and he was instantly
filled with remorse. </p>

<p>It was a thing that was as hard for him to do as it is for a runbit
to walk up to a man, but he approached her slowly and stood before her.
He gently drew her trembling form into his huge embrace. Silently he
held her, and neither moved nor spoke, until he felt her body still
itself. He looked into her eyes and saw a thing no flesh should ever
see, -- a thing that should be the sacred reserve of the unknowable
One, Itself. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He had long craved their love; long has he wanted them to believe
that he wanted nothing for them but the good. But this thing in her
eyes--it was beyond love, gratitude, or any describable emotion, it was
a thing forbidden, it was a thing that bound him, enslaved him, left
him with nothing for a reason to exist but to protect her--protect
them; all the weak and oppressed, the poor and the mistreated. </p>

<p></p>

<p>May the unknowable One, receive his soul this instant, for there is
nothing he will not do to free them from fear and harm. His life...his
soul, no longer felt his own possession. It was now hers...It was <i>theirs</i>,
and he had never felt happier in his life for purpose; to be reborn
from the son of a god of this world; to the servant of a trembling
Woman. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">'You wanted something, moth-- I mean, daug--?" </font></font><font size="4">His
senses led him to almost call her mother. Why? He felt nothing like it
before, although this is the first time she had ever stood still around
him long enough for him to really see and sense her. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Yes." </font></font><font size="4">She
interrupted him, spoke out of a turn, and if that wasn't enough to
surprise him, her utterance of the next words carried a tone that was
so close to Atlantean Elite arrogance, a faint urge--born of old
breeding-- arose in him to engage her for her impertinence toward one
of the high born. Only because it was so distant from any realms of
expectation from the timid runbit that was this much oppressed woman. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"What causes one born of a woman to call his deliverer, daughter?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>It was not that he was without understanding, even in an incredulous
state that was only a razor's edge away from shock, for his intuition
was keen, but it was her eyes, the tenderness of the fingers caressing
his face that spoke loudest, and most convincing. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He slowly distanced himself from her. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Dost
thou know how long and hard I have searched for the answers to whom I
am? Why I am so different from all the others? Tell me Mother, for I
have loved thee exceedingly when I thought thee to be my inferior. Thou
art not of the Humans, but of those we-- they, call mushskin, Igigis,
Cushites, Men, Women, Omans, chattel, slave. Yet, thou art my mother
and one puzzle has been solved for me. Thank thee, but come, tell me
more, for I am as one who has long suffered from an unquenchable
thirst."</font></font><font size="4"> He motioned to her to sit. He
noticed her body language had changed with her tone. It was a little
disconcerting, but he was inwardly pleased that she was exhibiting less
fear. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Thou truly delighteth me this day, Mother." </font></font><font size="4"><i>Mother</i>, he liked the feeling he got from saying the word-- a feeling he had never had the pleasure of knowing before this day.</font></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Not only hath my long search ended but the object of it is mine to
protect and hold dear forever. I will have the rest of the story that
thou can tell of the mysteries of my life but first I must ask
thee...give me one good reason why I should not slay the one thou now
call husband, for I have been recently informed about his crimes
against thee and the little ones, back in Atlantis. Yet, I wish not to
introduce judgment and death to this new world so soon. " </p>

<p>"Mercy, my Lord.&#8221; </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Did thou not ask how one born of a woman, calls her, daughter? How
then, doth one who brings forth life call that worm her superior?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"I spoke in jest because you made me feel so..." </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p>

<p>"Yes, you made me feel safe... and free." </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Thou art safe <i>and</i> free. Free, to live life devoid of all
imposed delusions. Thou art not an Adamite. Thou know even more than I
what my father is." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Your father is one of those who had the power of life and death
over all in Atlantis. What do you think that makes him to those of my
kind?" </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"It makes him a Tyrant. Now, an irredeemable, murderous tyrant. "</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"It makes him a tyrant to the strong like you. To the weak like my
people it makes him whatever he imposes upon us to believe him to be.
That's why I will not strip you of your strength in word or deed. You
are the hope we have in this new world; for the Lords are sure to come
to claim this place and people." </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Then thou, like the Adamites, will insist upon calling demons, gods?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"As I will insist on calling you-- our defender-- god, because A-tom
could Lord it over us with no more of the authority than that which is
granted by the rights of power.&#8221; </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"The Cushites were never that weak mother and the Sorcerers were
never that powerful. I know because I was raised among them. Atlantis
and the Cushites have been destroyed only because thou never united. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"They had the blue light of death. They and all their toadies.&#8221; </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"But the Cushites were the world. They didn't have to fight the
Demons by their own methods. The demons will always thrive in those
kinds of upheavals, but if the Cushites of Atlan, had united, stood
still, and refused to be moved, they would be alive today. " </p>

would have attacked us pitilessly. The destruction of Atlan is not the
shock to me that it is to you, Lord. My People have always known what
they were capable of. " </font></font></p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"When I say, stand still, I speak of deeper things, mother--secrets
of Sorcerers. Thou would not understand, but the demons would have
trembled if the Cushites of Atlan had united and stood still." </p>

<p>Marduk found it increasing hard to recognize in her, the woman that
first walked through his door. Within minutes she had changed from a
runbit, to actually arguing with him. He had witnessed the Cushites all
his life. But that was mostly in Atlan. When he thought about it
deeper, here, in Babylon, the former slaves were all growing in
arrogance. Especially, the younger ones. Maybe it was because he gave
them nothing to fear from him. Maybe it was because the Adamites, with
their ceaseless bowing and gyrating, were filling their heads. </p>

<p>Five minutes ago, he was bemoaning how she acted so afraid of him;
now he was resentful that she wasn't giving him his "due" respect. He
laughed inside...at himself. He continued with his explanation: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"It was only after the Cushites were taught how to fight that the
destruction of Atlan could have happened, because by universal law, the
demons are weakened by violence and death, unless they are met by
it--in which case it becomes a boon for them to slaughter. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Are you saying, Lord, that for my people the choices were always
either docile slavery or wholesale destruction? And this by the will of
A-tom?" </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4"></font></font><font size="4">

<p>She all but spat at him. Finally, Marduk was convinced that this
woman wasn't of two natures. She was only shrewd-- a shrewdness born of
knowing nothing but injustice and powerlessness all her life. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"No, mother, I've already said the Cushite should have fought, and
from the very beginning. But the only way they can fight evil without
making evil stronger, is by not mixing atoms." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Mixing atoms?" </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Yes, mother, it's like breaking open a sealed container of gases by
smashing it with another container of gases. When people engage each
other in any activity that stirs up their atoms, there is a mixing. In
this solar system any mixing of atoms between good and evil always
strengthen evil." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Always Milord? And never the other way around?&#8221; </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"In this solar system, yes-- always. But in the rest of the
universe, there are Entities we Sorcerers call pure atom Defenders.
They are like tiny suns--masses of energy bursts from the unknowable
One, Itself. They devour evil like fire consumes cotton. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p>"Pure atom Defenders?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Can I get thee anything to eat Mother...drink? I think thou may have as many questions of me as I have of thee." </p></font></font><font size="4">

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"This solar system is thoroughly evil, Mother. It has been overcome
by evil long ago. It thrives on evil and it rewards nothing but evil." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Then why are the Igigis here, Lord? What hope for the Cushites in this space?" </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Many of the Population of Atlan were Captives and their
Descendants---stolen from other galaxies and planets. The

not of the original flaw that caused evil to be born in the universe,
thou art of the correction." </p>

unknowable One, created a perfect universe but it was that very
perfection that caused the unforeseen flaw. When It created the

universe, everything inside of creation was made to continuously expand

&nbsp;It was the perfect design to fill up space, in a creation that
was meant to house numberless Beings that never died and never stopped
reproducing. However, what was perfect for the rest of creation was the
exact opposite of what would have been perfect for the kind of Entities
that were meant to fill this space. Like the rest of creation, the
beings thou call gods, never stopped growing and neither did their

<p><font size="4">Marduk paused and looked at his Mother, closer. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Art
thou sure thou need to hear all this Mother? I had thought to get thee
to fill up the holes in my family history. I really see no purpose in
burdening thee with the history of the Saurians. It is not a story for
polite company." </font></font></p>


<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Indulge my curiosity a little longer, please my Lord. I think if I
knew of the making of the old ones, maybe I can comprehend in some
measure what drives them that they can plot to destroy an entire
innocent people. Sometimes understanding your fears is the first step
to overcoming them. " </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4"></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk nodded at the wisdom of her point, and wondered how she knew
to blame the Saurians, and not the Sumerian Sorcerers for Atlan's
destruction. </p>
