</font><p><font size="4"><font color="#800080">"The demons were
created, having no way to control or limit either the growth of their
bodies or their wants and desires. This is the kernel of the great
flaw, and it is the reason there is evil in the universe. Because their
hungers were of ever heightening self-gratification, and they had no
innate ability to restrain themselves from acting on any desire that
entered their minds, there was nothing that was off limits or out of
bounds to them. They were pure selfishness, and they were a pure
selfishness that lived long, long lives. In all that time they never
stopped physically growing</font></font><font size="4">. </font></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>In the beginning they were eventually dying off everywhere, although
they were created to live forever. This was because they never got
enough of eating, sex, drinking, money and the wars that were required
to supply their ever growing gluttony. </p>

<p>Nothing was ever enough, and their insatiable greed, as well as
their ponderous size, was an inevitable path to self extermination. The
Universe was cleansing itself of the great flaw, and it was no
injustice because most of the Saurians had become evil demons and they
were the instruments of their own destruction. When they had eaten all
the vegetation on their planets they started eating each other. </p>

<p>The Universe was created to be inhabited-- not just this solar
system-- but every solar system and Galaxy in the ever-expanding
Cosmos. The Saurians were supposed to fill the Universe, but instead of
filling the Universe, they were actually receding from it. Planet,
after Planet was depopulated. </p>

<p></p>

<p>So the machine/system/Universe, the unknowable One had set into
motion, had to create something else of energy filled, flesh and blood
containers, to fill a void that cannot be allowed to remain empty or
the entire Universe will one day collapse in on itself. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If the system had waited just a little longer before it started
creating new Creatures, this long nightmare that the innocent species
of the Universe has been going through would have never happened. But
once It sensed that the planets were not being filled, the System began
to create again. It created new flesh and blood to supplant the
Saurians who were not fulfilling their role. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The system had learned from its initial mistake. The new caretakers
of the Creator's works(WoManbeings) were made to grow independent of
the Universe and not in sync with it. Unlike the Saurians, the
woManbeings stopped growing at a certain point, and they were made with
the ability to limit and control every aspect of their wants and
desires. "</p>

<p>Tefnut was leaning forward, perched on the edge of her seat. </p>

<p>Marduk sat the glass down and leaned back in his own chair which he had dragged from his work table. </p>

would have been a salvageable situation if Anu, had not been born so
power mad." </p>

she used his name. He wondered if she was the one who named him. </font></p>

He was not actually talking about Onanes--the Anu-- she knew as first
man, but each first man, of each regeneration of WoMankind on earth,
had made the same mistake of being selfish and power mad, so he <i>may as well</i>
had been talking about her first, father. Still, he knew better than to
speak of the first father with disrespect to a Cushite. He knew what
Onanes was really like, but to the Cushites, the first man will always
be an object of reverence. </font></p>
