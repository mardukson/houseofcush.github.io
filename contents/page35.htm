<p>"You--you, were saying how the system created the Igigis too soon.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk took the hint and found his place in the story. It annoyed
him a little bit more each time she called her, and her people
Igigis,--especially since he sensed that she was a lot smarter, and
aware of the deeper things of life than the average Cushite. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Yes, it was too soon, because even though An-- uh, the first WoMan
beings, were born on the other side of the world from where the demons
lived, they didn&#8217;t stay in their place.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk was careful how he chose his next words. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"They wanted to rule and take over the earth. I guess they were born
with that inclination in them because they were made by the system to
replace the Saurians in filling the Universe. Again-- to shortened this
long story, -- the first WoMan-beings left their spot. They soon
learned the Saurians saw no more wrong in eating, raping and torturing
them, than they did in doing it to each other. It was a tragedy for the
other species of the Universe, because the Saurians eventually
recognized a collation between the slowing of their growth, with the
eating of the WoMans and other latter born species. </p>

<p>Over time, the Saurians realized that by ingesting the blood and
essence of the WoMans, they too stopped growing at a certain point. . </p>

<p>Along with their smaller size, all of their other appetites became
more manageable too. Eating of flesh was a beneficial thing for the
Saurians, but it was the beginning of a long nightmare for WoManity,
and the other species that came along after them. </p>

<p>This is the origin of what thou Cushites, call sacrifice to the
gods, and it is the beginning of the long nightmare to fall over the
entire Universe. </p>

<p>The Saurians were no longer self-destructing. To reclaim their
original destiny was all their collective mind thought about at this
point. Having to spend far less time on seeking ways to satisfy their
appetites, the Ancient reptiles, were able to give more time to
thinking and plotting. </p>

<p>They evolved to become a highly intelligent species. They put most
of that intelligence into finding ways to stop the WoMans from usurping
their original destiny. They were determined to turn the table and
avenge themselves on WoManity, the system, and the unknowable One. </p>

<p>They have been tormenting the species of the Universe ever since. By
cannibalizing WoManity, they eventually evolved to become like the
woman born people. Plus, they had an advantage over every other species
because they were of one mind and could act as one body, for any
purpose. Power is in unity. And unity nearly gave the Saurians the
entire Universe. </p>

<p>At their highest point, there were billions of them throughout the galaxies." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Billions?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk nodded, bemused by his Mother's sometimes childlike way of putting forth a question. </p>

<p>When she did that, her tone and facial expression made her look near the spitting image of her youngest daughter Nephetis. </p>

<p>When the youngest Cushites were around him, the inquisitive young
girl had more questions than a math exam, and she fired them at him
like blue streaks--short, fast and precise. The most wondrous thing was
that the tiny girl grasped the answers to her questions as quickly as
she asked them. He could already picture the girl's brilliant mind
doing great things for Babylon. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Bringing his mind back around to the present, he answered his mother: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Yes, but not anymore. While the Saurians have been hunting the
other species of the Universe, and warring against all creation, the
Pure Atom Defenders has been hunting and warring against them. </p>

<p>The Saurians sought to rival the unknowable One, in the gathering of
atoms to themselves. They know that their only hope to avoid
extinction, is to fill the Universe with evil atoms before the
correction--WoManity-- can expand throughout the Universe, and fill it
with atoms devoted to the unknowable One. But their constant
disruptions and attacks on the systematic flow of atoms to and from the
unknowable One, has caused the pure atoms, of the Universe, to move to
defend the unknowable One. </p>

<p>This is why I said the Cushites need do naught but stand still to
fight Evil. By not engaging and mixing their atoms with the atoms of
the demons, they make it easier for the pure atom defenders to discern
who to attack. They also make it easier for the flesh and blood
Warriors who fight the Saurians and their pawns, by depriving them of
manpower and riches. The Cushites, art of the uncorrupted creation.
They art not made to shed atoms. They will always suffer for it which
is why those such as I, who have enhanced themselves to fight evil, do
so knowing we will ultimately suffer the same eternal punishment as
evil." </p>

</font><p><font size="4">Tefnut gently caressed her son's face. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"No",</font></font><font size="4"> she whispered. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"You have only become what you were called to be." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Distress not, over my ultimate fate, Mother. I knew the risk. I
hath chosen freely--not by the predestined wiles of thy prayers. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"But you have done no wrong! It will not be as you say! </font></font><font size="4">"The distress in her tone betrayed the fear underlying the attempt to deny the truth of his words. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4"><font color="#800080">"It is not a matter of wrong or
right, mother. The unknowable One is motion. It is a system that turns
on energy-- not philosophy, flesh, or moral constructs. Though to the
carnal mind, my saying those of the uncorrupted creation should stand
still in the face of evil sounds like passively giving in to evil; it
is actually the opposite, because positive Atoms does not weaken evil
atoms by mixing energies, it weaken evil atoms by allowing it nothing
of its own energy." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"My people did stand still! All it got them was centuries of torture and slavery. Then finally mass destruction!" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Her tone was tinged with anger. Marduk couldn't discern if the
distress was more due to what he said about the Cushites, or what he
said about himself. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"To the uninitiated, it seems like evil wins when it destroys an
innocent people, but to those who understand the Universe, we know that
the bigger blow to evil is wielded by the Saint, not by the Warrior.
But still, there art those who will be Warriors, e'en though we know
the consequences to our own souls. But the Warrior never wins the
battle of an entire people. Only the Innocents, acting according to the
laws of uncorrupted creation, can defeat evil that comes against them.
A Warrior's reward is the honor and satisfaction of being the
instrument of the people's will for justice and freedom. That is reward
enough for me, mother. The atoms within me are too mixed for me to
aspire to eternity." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font></font><p><font size="4"><font size="4">She began to sob. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"No! Do you have any idea, how such talk saddens me?" </font></font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"I'm sorry mother. Will thy heart have me continue to speak with honestly? " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Tefnut sat up straighter. She forced the command of her emotions. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"We stood still, Milord,"</font></font><font size="4"> She insisted. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"For
a million years the Igigis, stood still, and there were no victories,
and in the end there was no justice;only the reward of cattle, who
stands still in view of the slaughter house." </font></font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"No, Mother. The Cushites of Atlan didn't fight for freedom and
life, but they didn't stand still either. If they had stood still, not
a single pebble would have been overturned in all of Atlan. No riches
to be made and stolen by the demon spawn. Dost thou understand, mother?
The demons would have gained naught; they would have never gained the
power and inventions it took to destroy Atlan and all the other
civilizations they have wrecked. And it would have never been a gain to
them to destroy the people, only a great loss. It is not for those of
the uncorrupted creation to fight evil. Only the enhanced can fight
fire with fire. But the Cushites could have helped their Defenders by
not making their Tormentors strong with distressed atoms and material
wealth. They were destroyed because as a species they never united, and
they were in an ancient war with a species that was as united as the
fingers on one hand" </p>
