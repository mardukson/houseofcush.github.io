<p>"Let me tell you a story Mother... </p>

<p></p>

<p>... The demons had destroyed and enslaved many planets, worlds, civilizations, and peoples before they did the same to Atlan. </p>

<p></p>

<p>There were once a people who lived on a planet called Indo. The
People on this planet were very generous, peaceful and inventive. They
valued life, freedom and knowledge before all else. They were as
one--united--and making great strides in space exploration. </p>

<p>Then one day the demons in their never ending quest for riches and
distressed atoms, invaded the planet of Indo. As usual, they tried
first to frighten the people of Indo into submission with their tricks,
lies, and gadgets. But the people of Indo would not succumb to fear, or
manipulation, for they were not a primitive people. So the demons made
war with the Indo people to conquer and enslave them. </p>

<p>Scores, then hundreds and finally millions of the people of Indo
were slaughtered, but not only did they not submit to the demons, they
stood still, refused to fight, work at their factories, or to till the
ground. They learned to survive strictly on what their planet naturally
gave them. </p>

<p>All the toadies the demons entranced and possessed, to help them
conquer the people of Indo starved to death because they didn't know
how to think, run the factories or how to live off the land. To avoid
rape, torture and humiliation, all the people of Indo carried a special
poisonous plant with them which they kept in a locket that they wore
around their necks at all times. When the toadies would come for them,
they would fearlessly laugh, take of the poison and pass unmolested
onto the next phase of their existence. </p>

<p>The demons could get no production or distressed atoms from the free
people of Indo and because they are a hive collective; when the demons
on Indo started losing the strength of their atoms, all the demons
everywhere throughout the Universe were also weakened in their ability
to possess and mind control other Beings. The demons also lost the
financial ability to hire mercenaries from other planets, and to
replenish their dwindling weapons supply. They had invested and gambled
so much upon the conquest of Indo, they could not adequately supply any
of their other holdings throughout the Universe. </p>

<p>Finally, the purity of the demon's evil atoms--being unmixed with
the atoms of the people of Indo-- aroused and attracted the pure atom
defenders of the holy energy, that is the unknowable One. The Pure Atom
defenders attacked and vaporized so many of the weakened Saurians,
every planet in the galaxy, but one, were eventually free of them. </p>

<p>The Pure Atom Defenders pursued the Saurians and those allied with
them, all over the Universe until the only place left to the Saurians,
was their original birth place, which is this solar system. Only here
could the demons be safe from the pure atom Defenders but only because
they began here, and universal justice required that because it was the
unseen flaw that made them what they are, they can only be destroyed in
this Galaxy through their own evil deeds. They are compelled to kill,
oppress and destroy, but they are also compelled to self-destruct. They
would had self-destructed Ages ago, and the reason they did not is a
long story which I will not burden thee with this day." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk realized he had strayed off subject. He coughed and grinned
sheepishly at Tefnut before resuming the story of the people of Indo. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Though only a fraction of the people of Indo was left alive from
their ordeal with the demons;with the demons gone, they soon began to
thrive again. All of the murdered were reborn so quickly that today
they are dispersed among many planets throughout the Galaxies.<br>
</p>
<p>The point is mother, the Indo people--unlike all other species--
somehow knew they had to be willing to die in order to truly live. They
are the only species and civilization, out of untold millions, who ever
resisted the demons effectively. They not only resisted them, they
broke their power throughout the Universe, forever. </p>


<p>Many Species and peoples met the demons with force. Some even caused
the demons to retreat. But the demons will always return to meet
destruction with destruction, and they had always eventually won; so
much so that they all but owned the Universe until they took on the
planet of Indo. </p>

<p>The people of Indo has won the Universe because they expanded by cherishing freedom, life, unity and knowledge. </p>

<p>After the victory of Indo, the demons could no longer prosper
because more and more of the people of the Universe started to choose
the path of the Indo people when the demons came among them. This left
the demons easy prey for the Pure Atom Defenders from the unknowable
One. </p>

<p>Today, the Pure Atom Defenders are watching them; that they do not
leave this solar system. Neither the Saurians, their seeds, nor any who
ally with them, can leave this solar system without being immediately
destroyed. This is why they will not allow any others to leave, either.
But I shall free the Cushites and Adamites from the evil prison,
mother." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Why did the pure atom Defender wait so long to attack? And where are they now?&#8221; </font></font><font size="4">Tefnut asked. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"It is a catch22, mother. First, the pure Atom Defenders can't
bother the demons when they stay in this solar system. And when the
demons once nearly ruled the entire Universe, the Defenders couldn't
engage them because the Saurians always ruled through proxy--mixed atom
toadies. </p>

<p>When the demons go outside this solar system, they always send
colonists first. These Colonists were always mixed-atom WoMans, who are
evil enough to serve their Masters, but not so evil that they were pure
enough to attract the Pure Atom Defenders. The Defenders are energy.
They can only attack pure evil. They can't discern their purpose when
the atoms are too mixed between the demons and those of uncorrupted
creation. By the time the Demons invade a planet in full force, their
toadies had already paved the way by corrupting the planet's population
with the lies, and all the other techniques the Saurians hath devised
in their long existence, and exhausted study of the nature of the
species of the Universe." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Tefnut interrupted; her voice shrill with excitement. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Excuse me my Lord, but you said your atoms were mixed! That would mean the pure atoms defenders can't attack you." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Marduk laughed softly. Her determination regarding his ultimate fate was as endearing as it was unyielding. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"That's true Mother... if the mixture is not overly bias towards the
evil atoms, which mine are not today, but my destiny is to destroy the
very seat of evil itself. The day that I do this, I will become all but
pure evil because of the mixing of atoms. This is my reward and my
punishment for enhancing myself through the practice of sorcery." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Tefnut visibly deflated. But in the back up her mind she still
refused to believe that her son had no hope of redemption. Even the
strongest of evil has freewill, and her son's will to do good was
stronger than anything in the Universe but the unknowable One. Even if
he didn&#8217;t believe that himself, she did, and she will never accept that
his fate will be as he says. </p>

<p></p>

<p>In another part of her mind she heard Marduk saying: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"When the people of the Universe stopped releasing their atoms to
mix with the demons by fighting and dying in fear, the demons were left
in their pure evil state to face the wrath of the legions of the
unknowable One." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Does that mean also the opposite, Lord... that even if you became
pure evil, you will have to keep doing evil to keep your atoms from
being infiltrated by good atoms? So if you were to do nothing but
good... " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk followed her line of thinking. She just refused to give up. Her love for him was real. It was obvious and pure. </p>

<p></p>

<p>In the Atlantean language "mer" meant beloved. He looked into her
eyes. And from his lips came the closest word to express what was in
his heart at that moment. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Theoretically that's true, Meri.&#8221;</font></font><font size="4"> He watched her face light up.</font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"> "But it is very difficult for evil to change, because good atoms don't attract to evil easily. It <i>is </i>possible
to do enough good to attract positive atoms to evil, but the pull of
evil atoms to make an evil person more evil is almost unconquerable.</font></font><font size="4">" </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">She understood what he was saying, but in it she was
still comforted because she knew that whatever her son was destined to
do, there will always be a spark of good inside of him. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Mother...?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Yes, my Lord?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"May I continue to call thee, Meri?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"If I can call you Merodach." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk's brain instantly translated. "<i>Beloved son</i>" </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"I'd like that, and I'd far prefer it to being called Lord --especially by my superior.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Where are the pure atom Defenders now Lor--Merodach?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>She had never heard of such Entities before this day, but she found
a comfort that she had never felt in her life, knowing they existed. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Today the Pure Atom Defenders are watching that the demons do not
leave this solar system. That's why the demons were so determined to
kept the Cushites of Atlan stuck on earth even though they had the
technology to travel the Universe for a million years. They will do the
same to the Adamites. In time, -- for one gigantic burst of energy and
power, -- they will destroy the Adamites just like they did the
Cushites of Atlan, and so many other species throughout the Ages. </p>

<p>I could have taken thee and the others to a new galaxy Meri, but I
chose to return to earth because I know here is the demon's last stand.
I intend to crush them once and for all while they are weak and stuck
in this solar system. I'm glad I made that choice to return to earth
because I didn't know the Adamites survived the nuclear holocaust...
and so many of them. </p>

<p>As thou know, the Demons will be coming to try to rule, and
slaughter amongst the Adamites, to gain from their distressed atoms. I
will not allow them to use the Adamites to regain an ounce of their
lost power. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Tefnut sighed deeply. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Will it ever be over? Will the world ever know anything other than horror?" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Sadly no, Mother&#8230;not until the demons are destroyed forever. They
are always going to do what they do and be what they are. As long as
they exist, there will be no end of sorrow for some beings in the
Universe. They will always create, tamper with, and manipulate innocent
life." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You will protect us here. A-tom has promised." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"It will end up like Atlantis unless we win." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>The word "we" screamed inside of Tefnut&#8217;s head. She thought of her
children, and all the pain, rage and hopelessness,--carried over from
Atlantis-- converged upon her at once. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You will leave the Igigis out of this! We have suffered enough! " </p></font></font><font color="#000000" size="4">Marduk was no longer surprised by her sudden shifts in temperament. He responded coolly to her outburst.<font size="4">

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Meri, do you know what the great martyr of Indo said about life?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>She knew what he was referring to but she did not respond. He recited it anyway. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"He, who loves his life in an evil world, will lose it, but he who hates his life in an unjust world will gain it forever. </p>

<p>I will teach the Adamites and the Cushites this, Mother. I will
teach them to love death as they love life. I shall teach them to love
freedom so much that they will prefer death over slavery, like one
prefers water to drink over acid." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Tefnut shook her head. New tears clouded her eyes. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Marduk's tone softened to a whisper. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Meri&#8230;&#8221;</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p><font size="4"></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I know you are right...I just thought ..." </font></font><font size="4">Her voice trailed off. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Marduk could easily imagine what she thought, but he
can't save the Adamites from the demons without the Cushites. Because
of their organically chipped brains, most of the Adamites are going to
worship and empower the demons. His hope was that a significant number
of them might be de-programmed before the demons returned. One Cushite
was worth a million Adamites to him in this battle because the Cushites
had normal, rational brains. Even though in Atlan, they had been beaten
down by a million years of brutality, indoctrination and oppression;to
regard the Saurians, as divinely anointed masters, the Cushites were
not born grovelers. In a million years they never stopped rebelling
against the "gods" even though they never won a war in this solar
system, and the punishment for rebellion was always a cruelty that
exceeded the bounds of imagination. His hope was that by the time the
demons returned, there will be millions of Cushites on earth who has
never known the yoke of fear, indoctrination or slavery. </font></p>

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"I know it is a bitter pill to swallow."</font></font><font size="4"> He caressed her hand. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"But there is truly no other way." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Why has A-tom done this? Why doesn&#8217;t the most high one, fix Its mistake? It has been too long. It's too much, too...much. " </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Meri, listen. Listen to me."</font></font><font size="4"> He waited until she stopped sobbing and looked at his face. </font></p>

<p></p><font size="4"></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"There are things you have to understand to find comfort. Nothing
ever truly dies. The unknowable One has not abandoned the Universe to
evil. The mistake is being corrected. Thou dost not see it because
compared with the age of the Universe thou have only been here for a
brief moment. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I am older than you."</font></font><font size="4"> She interjected. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Marduk huffed. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"But
thou atoms art not older than mine, it is within our DNA, that our true
age is recorded. I am full of the atoms of my father, and he of his
father, bull--&#8221; </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"></font></font><font color="#ff00ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"-- I know...Bullasaurus.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>She smirked at him, her teary countenance suddenly devilish, and he
realized he was being teased. More humbled, he continued where he had
left off answering her questions: </p></font></font></body></html>
