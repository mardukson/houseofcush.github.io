<p>"There were once billions of demons, all throughout the Universe.
They were the first born of all creation. Now they art only a few. They
seem many because of their ability to manipulate, buy, and control the
minds of other Beings. They also mix their seeds with every species
they conquer, but still their numbers dwindle continuously, as meant by
the Universe in Its ongoing effort to cleanse itself. There <i>is</i> justice, Mother. And there will <i>be </i>justice. A-tom has put into motion the correction. It just takes a long lived sorcerer to see its progress." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Your constant harps about justice give me no comfort, Merodach." </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p>He winced. She continued: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"There can be no justice for those who have been tortured to death.
It is one thing to die, but the Lords were never satisfied with murder.
A-tom, itself, can never justify for me what they have done to so many
for so long. I seek not justice Merodach, but life again for my people.
Perform your destiny, my beloved son, but do not use the pitiful few
that are left of my people as your choice of weapon. I prayed for you
to protect my children, not wear them as a sword and shield. " </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p>Her tone was not assaultive, yet if words had mass, he definitely
would have felt punched. He was beginning to understand his mother, but
each time he thought he had assessed her true spirit; she raised the
bar, yet again. She switched personalities and moods like a long
tortured WoM-- suddenly a conversation he had with Inanna popped into
his mind. He remembered making her a promise. Now he had twice the
motivation to keep that oath. The Sumerian Sorcerers will pay for what
they have done to his mother. Djhuty will pay. </p>

<p>He will not act outside of the bounds of justice in regards to the
Priest, because as a Sorcerer he knew what putting into motion a foul
energy would mean to the future of this new world. But Djhuty will
slip. He had no doubts of that. As for the demons, they will be back.
But swathed in their arrogance and blinded by their consuming need to
be worshiped, they will have no idea what will be awaiting them on
their return. Even if they know him to be an enemy, they will never
know of the fire-- the inferno that rages within his breast, until it
is too late. When it is too late, then they will know that he is the
SUN-- the all consuming wrath of a million years of cries for vengeance
and justice. </p>

shall make the earth a new Indo. I will call it Babylon--gateway to the
unknowable One. I shall teach the Cushites and Adamites to purify their
atoms so that they may join the rest of the free peoples of the
Universe in unifying with the unknowable One. They will gain the
freedom to go where they will throughout the Galaxies. But first we
must face the demons. " </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Tefnut put her hands to her mouth. Her eyes searched his face. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"A new Indo?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">He nodded. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Thou

<p>She smiled. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Mother... " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Her head lifted. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Would thou speak on an intimate matter with me?&#8221; </p>

<p>"Yes.&#8221; </p>

<p>"The seeds of thee and the criminal, Djhuty...these are my half siblings?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You earlier asked for a reason not to kill my husband, Merodach.
Know this; if you execute the man, Djhuty, you will be bound by justice
to slay me too; for I am as much a criminal as he." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Thou were a born and bred slave, Mother. I know what hath made thee.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Then you know it is not in the death of the man Djhuty that you will find true justice." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Thou speak the truth Meri. I shall spare the man, Djhuty for his
past crimes, but this is a new world and a new reality, if he ever doth
evil to another on this world, I promise justice will be swift.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Tefnut nodded. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I have defended the life of this man, only to defend my own life. May his crimes in this new world be on his own head. " </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Marduk grinned internally, at how certain
situations turned the meek woman towards a ferociousness that normally
suited her in no measure. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Suddenly he frowned, </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Meri, do you remember that day when thou brought my siblings before me. Tell me, thou didn&#8217;t really think I -- &#8220; </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"--I have always known my son. I brought the little ones to you that
day so they would know you too, and not be afraid of you. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>" But, thou rushed them from my presence so swift, and thou has
avoided or tipped around me like I was the Azog, Itself. It has not
been a good feeling for me, mother." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I
avoided you because after all those aching years apart from you in
Atlan, I was suddenly close enough to you to touch you, hold you, talk
to you. I didn't want you</font></font><font size="4"> </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">to
know your mother was a weak, abused nobody. I knew it would take from
your pride and image of yourself. I didn't want to weaken you ". </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Thou couldn't have been more wrong, mother. I had no pride in being
the son of a demon Sorcerer, and I drew no strength from it." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"That&#8217;s not true Merodach. Your Father has given you much. And his
kind is only a demon to my kind. To his own, he is much loved and
revered by many. " </p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Surely Meri, after what happened to Atlan, thou art not still emotionally bound to thy tormentors." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You don't understand." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"There is much I don't know or understand Meri. Please stay a while
longer. The day is young and I still wish to hear what you can tell me
of the unknowns of my life." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Where do I begin?" </font></font><font size="4">Tefnut asked. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"I want to know it all. Start at the beginning." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"The beginning is neither your, nor my story.&#8221;</font></font><font size="4"> She teased. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Marduk laughed, more to show his appreciation at her
attempt to be light than of actual mirth. He was pleased to see this
woman he had never seen in any other state by palpable sadness so
relaxed in his company. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"But tell me, Meri, What doth thy know of Atum?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>She rewarded his attempt to match her play with a girlish giggle. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I know Its name should be pronounced A-tom--not Atum&#8220;.</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">He laughed again and Tefnut brimmed with joy. </font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Besides,"</font></font><font size="4"> she added,&#8221;</font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4"> I didn't mean A-tom, I meant the Lords. Before our kind, there were first the Lords." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Thou mean the Saurian demons." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"I mean the Ancient of days." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Let us not quibble Meri. Just knoweth thee, there is no love or
respect in me for the old ones and I'll accept that in thee there can
never be naught else." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"It&#8217;s not love and respect that I feel for them, Merodach. It is the
knowledge that where I came from, they also came, but they came before
me. That is all I give them, but it is none more than they deserve. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"They hate thee Meri. I know. I have lived among them and have been witness to their foul chatter. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Think you, Merodach, that I am ignorant to this? I who have seen
with my own eyes torture, slaughter and degradation of my kind since
long before you were ever conceived? " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Let us end this matter of discussion. I do not understand why thou
dost not burn with hatred of evil Meri, but thou need not, for I do so
for thee, and the day will come that I shall have the justice upon them
that thou dost not want or need. " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You truly do not understand Merodach, but know this: I know who you
are. Long have my people prayed to A-tom, and it are we who have made
you. It is not your father or I who have given life to you. My womb was
just the incubator that nourished the embryo of a prayer." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Strange mother, that A-tom should answer the prayers of a long suffering people with the seed of their tormentor.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Is it really, Merodach?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">The look on her face made Marduk want to mirror her emotion with his own. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Do not hate yourself my son." </font></font></p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"The part of me that is thee is all I cannot hate, Meri. I am of the
ones thou call Lords and I am of the WoMan race. The choice is mine and
I have long ago decided that I preferred to be the son of Man.&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Tefnut was silent for a long moment, as if digesting his words. Then abruptly she spoke: </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"It was forbidden." </font></font></p></body></html>
