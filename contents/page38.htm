</font><p><font size="4">Marduk looked startled. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"What? What was forbidden, Mother?"</font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Both the old ones and the all-Father, Anu, forbade it, but your
Father chose to defy the great mandate of the Ages, by not killing me
after he had me in lust." </p></font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><font color="#0000ff" size="4">

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Not killing you?&#8221; </font></font><font size="4">Marduk
was surprised. Saurians raped or otherwise had intercourse with the
Cushites all the time. It's true that caution was taken to ensure that
no Cushite female was impregnated. Technology made that as easy as
ingesting a pill, but his mother was making it sound as if things used
to be different--that murder after intercourse was once mandatory in
such relations. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"They said it was rape." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>His mother was jumping all over the place as if she was more
reliving the story than reciting it. He found it difficult to follow
her, but he did not wish to disturb her train of thought by telling her
so. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"But it wasn't."</font></font><font size="4"> She looked into his eyes. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I
have always known things, Merodach. My father was a Shaman and a keeper
of Igigis memories. That's why I know so many things most Igigis don't.
But it's not just of the past that I know things. Sometimes I can see
into the future." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Marduk pondered if maybe his innate magical abilities were not just
from one side of his bloodline as he had always thought. Saurians were
natural Telepaths because they come from a lineage where they were all
once connected by one mind. As they started mixing atoms with the
WoMans, this ability was diluted, although still strong in some Saurian
bloodlines. He heard his Mother saying: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"I knew what had to be done if the suffering of my people was to
ever end. My father was against it, but I so convinced the other
Elders, they overruled him and allowed me to carry out my plan." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk listened with great interest. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"I knew of your Father's habits. We all knew. Even though I did what
I did out of duty to my people, it was not all self sacrifice. There
was something different about your Father. Certain types of women are
always attracted to power and many Igigi females chased the Lords of
their own free will even though they knew that if a Lord should take
them in lust, without first taking precautions, they risked being
killed afterwards. There was a risk of being killed just because some
Lords were sadistic that way. That didn't stop some Igigi females from
chasing power even if they only got to be close to it for the length of
time it took for a Lord to satisfy himself. Of all the Lords, none were
more desired by Igigi women than your father." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Marduk frowned. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Does that include you, Meri?" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Tefnut shook her head.</font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">
"No. I never desired anything but a means to free my people from
torment. And I hated their tormentors. But your father...there was
something different about him, and my instincts told me that if my plan
had any chance of succeeding, the target had to be him. </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">For
weeks I would watch him. Your father had certain habits and routines
that he never altered. The one most germane to my plot was his morning
stroll through the east gardens. Every morning I would sit there by the
springs after first chasing the other women away. Every morning your
father would pass me like he always did all the other women. This was
one of the ways he was different. No other Lord would have passed up
the sexual opportunities your father did."</font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Thou did know who my father was, didn't thou Mother? Only demons
from the low houses mixed with the "chattel". It wasn't virtue that
stilled my father's lust, it was hauteur."</p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"That's true Merodach, but there was something else in his refusal
to take Igigi women. I sensed something in him I could feel from none
other of his kind but you. Your father was...soft." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Like me?"</font></font><font size="4"> Marduk laughed but Tefnut's tone harbored no mirth. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Yes, like you." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>It disturbed Marduk to be compared in any measure with his Father.
The fact that his Mother sensed kindness in him spoke to his Father's
favor--especially since his Father was second generation Saurian
mix-breed--only one Generational line removed from being full blooded
demon. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"To make my plan work, I had to get your Father to lie in lust with me." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>It was suddenly crystal clear to Marduk what her "plan" was. It
wasn't an especially good feeling knowing your existence is the result
of a calculated plot. But that very reality was probably why he was so
much different than others of his kind. He didn't hate the seeds of
woman; he felt the inborn need to protect them.</p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"How
did you finally manage it Mother...to get the Scion of one of the
highest houses in the solar system to slum it with a slave?"</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Tefnut smiled at his playful tone. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I took advantage of his softness. I lay in his path pretending that I had twisted my ankle. The rest of that story..."</font></font><font size="4"> She reached over and rubbed his hair. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Is you."</font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Marduk grinned. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"As I had hoped and expected, your father did not kill me after the
sex act was over even though he took no precautions beforehand. And
also, as I hoped, he would let no other Lord harm me--even after the
forced examination they put me through&nbsp; confirmed that I was
pregnant. Only a Lord as powerful as your Father could have withstood
the fury of tradition by flouting so, the great mandate of the Ages. I
knew this." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Thou took a great risk, Meri. The odds against things turning out as they did were astronomical."</font></font><font size="4"> He looked at her searchingly. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"The courage thou displayed then much belies the life thou hath led as a timid slave-- and with Djhuty. I don't understand." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You don't understand because you don't know me. But ponder these
things, Merodach, and eventually you will figure it out. I am the
daughter of free WoMans. I come from a long line of Shepherds. My
family line is as old and high a Cushite line, as your Father's is a
Saurian line. My oldest grandfather wrestled the first man, for the
right to course the path of the WoMan race during the days when men
first walked the earth. He lost the battle, but a remnant of the WoMan
race chose to follow his path. His ceaseless rebellion against Saurian
rule and assimilation eventually took them into the heavens and won for
them, paradise. It is in my blood--your blood-- to lead and sacrifice
for others. Even of our own freedom, happiness and dignity." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Marduk was so stunned all he could do was stare at his mother. How
did she know that the Cushites were once named WoMan-beings? His Mother
was WoMan royalty? <i>This</i> timid, abused woman? And if he understood her, she had just said her oldest grandfather--<i>his </i>oldest<i> </i>WoMan
grandfather--was the progenitor of the Indo civilization. The same
civilization that liberated the Universe, and gave birth to the great
Sage. How she has fallen. It saddened him deeply to think about it. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Oh, don't look so filled with pity, Merodach. &#8220;</font></font><font size="4"> She teased. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"You know what has been a great joy in my life?"</font></font></p><font size="4">

<p>Marduk shook his head. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"The way your Father loved you from the moment he saw you. I sensed
it. I had never felt such pure energy emanating from any living thing
as I did from your Father when he received you from my arms." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Despite himself, Marduk found that statement easy to believe. His
Father had always shown the utmost love and loyalty to him. His father
was the reason he was allowed to be the dissident against the Sumerian
guild that he was.</p>

<p>His mother said: </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"After
your father open the flood gates and got away with it, weaker Lords
started joining him. They too, harbored forbidden feelings for Igigi
women, and wanted to have families with them. This rebellion by your
father and the Lords who joined him, led to you Father being thrown out
of the Guild and the lesser Lords being cast out of the high cities to
live among the Igigis. </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">Your
father and the others then formed their own guild. They began to openly
break the great mandate of the Ages. They took to themselves many
Igigis, whom they bore children with. Through their own strength and
knowledge of sorcery, they were able to protect their offspring from
the wrath and fear of the old ones. Over time it was noticed that the
children born to the Lords and their Igigi wives were not only far
superior to other men, they were in some aspects even superior to the
Lords, because of their great size, intelligence, and longer arms.
These hybrids, like you..."</font></font><font size="4"> Tefnut smiled at her son.... </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"were
fearless, compassionate, and obsessed with a fire for justice in the
world and a need to defend the weak and abused. Some of them-- unlike
you--were even crueler than their fathers. It was because of them that
the civil war was fought." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Marduk didn't know about the honorable ones--"like him"-- she spoke
about, although he did know that some Saurian/WoMan, Hybrids like him,
from the distant past, was known for such commendable things. <br>
</p>
<p>As for the evil Hybrids, most of them were of the infamous
Tyrannosaurus clan-- the Titans,-- but they had been banished to Mars.
He had helped put them away himself. Even so, the only reason he wasn't
banished with them, was because of the influence and strength of his
Father. </p>


<p></p>

<p>Not all of the Saurian/WoMan, Hybrids were of the vicious
tyrannosaurus clan and not all were such psychopathic menaces. But the
Guild had punished them all the same. He somewhat regretted that. Many
of the big Oafs only crimes were being too clumsy for civilized living.
Even the gentlest of them were too rough, greedy, sex-mad and
undisciplined to live among the much put upon Igigis. At least that was
what his limited experience with those of his kind revealed. The Igigis
had enough problems with the demons, so he didn't regret too much his
hand in banishing the Giants. Not then, anyway. </p>

<p>He responded to his mother. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"I remember the Hybrids, but I know nothing of a civil war involving my kind. Please continue." </p>

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Your Father freed them from the prison planet and brought them back to earth.&#8221; </font></font><font size="4"></font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Marduk sighed and rubbed his palms across his face. </font></p>

<p></p>
