father recruited the Giants to help him take over Atlantis. The Rebel
Lords who joined him also begin to teach the Igigis the secrets and
arts of war. It was an ambitious, dangerous &nbsp;plan,--especially for
the Igigis, but your father promised us our freedom. Many of the Igigis
believed him. Most were too afraid to rebel. Others remained loyal to
the Lords. &nbsp;Finally, with their Giant sons and armies of
&nbsp;rebellious Igigis, your Father and the Lords with him made the
move &nbsp;to take over Atlantis. But your father had badly
miscalculated. The Sumerian Sorcerers were not as weakened by the split
in their ranks as he calculated because your father's own sibling
bolstered them. "</font>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" font="" face="Times New Roman" size="4">Marduk
thought of his Father's sibling. She was wholly male now from what he
last heard. Not only that, but Eeen. It didn't surprise him that the
ambitious toady would turn against the Scion of their house. What did
surprise him was that she/he had any power to be a factor. She was
Anu's right arm but she was never an accomplished enough Sorcerer to
merit any high position within the guild. </font></p><p>

Sumerian Sorcerers commanded many Igigis who fought as if they were
bewitched--like none has ever done before. My people were like rabid
Ograpes as they fought and slaughtered. Even in their crazed state they
would not touch the Lords but it was a terrible and brutal destruction
of men and giants. </font>

</p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" font="" color="#0080ff" face="Times New Roman" size="4">After
the war was decided, the Guild had all the wounded and captured Igigi
rebels tortured till they died. They &nbsp;forced the rebellious Lords
to watch as they tortured and executed the Giant sons they had with the
Igigi women. </font></p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" font="" color="#0080ff" face="Times New Roman" size="4">Defeated,
your father and all the rebellious Lords returned to their mansions
humbled and demoted in whatever station they held in life. But because
they were Lords they were not executed. I think it was then--after the
civil war-- that the decision was made to destroy Atlantis. The Lords
were terrified because for the first time since my great grandfather
escaped the earth, the Iggis had fought and been taught how to fight." </font>

never saw a soul, Mother,-- not even my own reflection. Before I left,
I knew how divided the Atlantean Elite were and I knew no one was going
to suffer in a power struggle between &nbsp;the Demons but the sons of

that was the will of my kind and the will of the old Ones. After we had
fought and been taught to fight, both we and the Lords knew things
could never be the same. We both had to change or die. The Igigis had
already changed, and the old ones determined that they would not.
Unfortunately they had all the power." </font>

atrocities that went on during &nbsp;my absence. I went to find the

left. Can you ever forgive me of my cowardice, Meri?" </font>

didn't know for certain of the civil war. And you couldn't have known
how desperate and afraid the Lords were. It's not your fault. It was
not the battle meant for you. Besides, the WoMans of Atlan had been
enslaved and tortured since the beginning of our time &nbsp;on earth.
We &nbsp;were not on this earth who we were meant by A-tom to be--
especially after we had been turned into vicious killers. We were
Djhuty. " </font>

am I, Merodach? Did I not allow the Lords and Djhuty to rape and
consume the minds and &nbsp;souls of my babies? As for Shu, Nut, Horus
and the others on this new world; they are your fight, Merodach. This
new world is your fight. This is why you were born and why A-tom
influenced you to leave the earth &nbsp;before the civil war in
Atlantis." </font>

still had not gotten over the distaste at his mother's callous
assessment of the fate of the slaughtered Cushites of Atlan, and his
tone reflected it. </font>

know why you were given to me because I'm the one who asked. &nbsp;I

are thee.". </font>

Hush Marduk ! I am not that much less knowing than you. Did you think
me without understanding of the story of the planet of Indo? I have
heard that story before you. My great grandfather was the founder of
Indo, and it is still his blood that runs through my veins. It was not
I who destroyed Atlantis, and it is not mine to pretend that I wished
the suffering of my people to go on and on when I know of my Ancestors
from Indo and how they found true life." </font>

</p><p>

</p><p><font class="fsx06" font="" color="#800080" face="Times New Roman" size="4">"The
difference is mother; the Indo people made the decision for themselves.

</p><p><font class="fsx06" font="" color="#0080ff" face="Times New Roman" size="4">"You
judge me to harshly, Merodach. I lived for you and my people. I would
have died for the same. I exist now only for you because you are the
hope of the Igigis left in this world. If you despise me, it is nothing
for me to release my atoms and join my people with A-tom, until I am

mentally kicked himself for once again underestimating her. His
compassion for the dead of Atlan was great, but he realized even if she
didn't wear hers like he did, her compassion was even greater because
she saw her dead alive and happy in the future and he could only see
them dead and buried in the past. </font>
