<br></font></div>

<div align="left"><font class="fsx06" face="Courier New">I, Marduk, son
of WoMan, leave this message to the abandoned children of Atlan, with
hope that one day they shall find strength in it to resist and free
their minds, if not their bodies, from monsters and demons that hold
power over none in the universe but the authority to deceive. <br>Odijah,
thou son of woman--who hath held fast to thy soul e'en through a
lifetime of abuse, deceit, indoctrination and torture; it is with the
ultimate confidence that I leave these documents in thy hands. hearken,
O' mighty one of spirit, that they do not fall under the eyes of the
Sumerian Sorcerers. <br>Trust not, e'en the beloved Inanna, but in
wisdom and guile, to these documents, acquaint all thy Kin without
jeopardizing thy precious life.</font><font class="fsx06" face="Flubber"> </font><br><font class="fsx06" face="Courier New">It
was not with sincere expectation that I searched for thy face among the
ones gathered to escape with me. Well did I know that thou would not
separate thy fate from thy cousins. It is with great sorrow and heavy
heart that I write these words. I abandon thee now only to create a
place for thy soul to rest from pain and sorrow forever and eternity. <br>Unmask the demons to all the sons and daughters of first Woman, as I unmask them to thee. <br>Farewell. Have faith that as long as the unknowable One, doth favor me, I shall never abandon the universe to thy Tormentors. <br>Seek
strength in the truth and trust in the Supreme Being of existence, whom
no tongue will ever name before universal revelation, but to whom, all
tongues shall one day give praise. <br></font></div>
