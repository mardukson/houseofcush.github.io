<div align="left"><font class="fsx06" face="Arial">They were a tightly
nit group of long lived Sorcerers, these architects and plotters of the
destruction of Atlan. May the words of this letter and the spirit of
all Cushites who learn of its content, keep the truth alive forever so
that the universe shall never forget and never allow the end of
explosions to their atoms, until they perish from existence. <br><br>Each
one had collected to themselves the riches generated by the Beings of
many civilizations. Upon all the planets of the Earth's solar system
they built many mansions which no people but their toadies have ever
been allowed into space to discover. <br><br>These were the ones who built civilizations at their leisure and destroyed worlds at their whim. <br><br>To
describe them is to reference from the WoManoids, though, behind the
fronts they prefer, they are 13 creatures as different in size,
appearance and temperament as the beasts that once roamed the dense
lands of Atlan. <br><br>To he who can discern, I shall name and
describe them here, though not all will be able to distance themselves
from the false perception of reality induced by black magic to
entertain the possibility that what I speak is truth and not fantasy. <br><br>I,
Marduk, uncover these monsters, here, for all future generations of
Beings, so that they may see that it is not omnipotent Entities that
destroy them but worms and lizards, whose greatest strength lie in the
hijacking and drugging of the collective mind of the WoMan race. <br>
<br>Hath
thou yet heard a voice from above and around saying to thee, bow down?
Hath thou heard a voice saying to thee give me this or that? Why then
doth thou, O'Cushites, obey unto the death, the conspiracies of demons? <br><br>Know
ye not, O' Cushites, that thou are made of the same star dust as those
who enslave thee and set themselves above thee as thy Superiors? <br><br>Follow
me back in time to the tens of billions years past and let me show thee
what thy have burnt thy Sons and Daughters upon the pit to, and under
the influence of what, thy have stained red the surface of the entire
earth. <br><br>Why hath thou not seen yet, O' Cushites; after thou
hath suffered and cried and worshiped for a million years, that only
demons feast on the misery and essence of thy torment? And thou art not
their love, but their hate? <br><br>Did the unknowable One, create the
universe to die? Why think thou then, that thou hath been made to offer
up thy children upon the altar, and to slaughter thy cousins? <br><br>Follow
O' Cushites, and I will take thee back to the beginning of time when
the great Will of creation, did cause two stars to collide and shower
upon the waters that then engulfed all the earth--thy gods. <br><br>But
first let me name them and give unto thee that much power over thy
tormentors. For they have hidden themselves behind many false titles
and fronts to deceive thee <br><br>Enki------WoManoid/serpent <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Erra------Winged dragon <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Ki-------Underground Serpent <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite .<br><br>Apep------serpent <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Nergal-----Tyrannosaurus <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Thoth------winged Serpent <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Inanna----WoManoid/Saurian <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Tiamat------Sea serpent <br><br>Know that enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Hadad-----winged dinosaur/dragon <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Nanna-----WoManoid/Saurian <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Ishkur-----winged dinosaur/dragon <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Ereshkigal-----dragon <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Ninhursag------WoManoid/Saurian <br><br>Know thy enemy O' Cushite. <br><br>Where forth come these immortal fiends? <br><br>Know
thee, O' Cushites, that these are the children of the stars of heaven.
Dust art they, incubated and nurtured by the womb of the deep waters of
the abyss. <br><br>Now look O' Cushites, with me into the windows of the past. <br><br>See the waters O' Cushites, which covereth the entire earth? <br><br>This is the Mother of thy gods. <br><br>See O' Cushites, the dust from heaven that showers upon the waters of the earth? <br><br>This is the father of thy gods. <br><br>See
thou, O' Cushites, within the waters the infinitesimal that will become
thy gods? And neither shall thee for ten billion years hence. <br><br>Let
us, O' Cushites, skip ahead ten billion years for tho' my years are
without number, thine are as fleeting as a midsummer storm. <br><br>Watch,
O' Cushites, as thy gods crawl from the womb of their mother to emerge
into the world in all their majestic glory. Where forth doth thou look
O' Cushites? Thy gods are not up there. Look lower O' Cushites. Lower.
Lower. Harder O' Cushites. Look harder, closer. The ground O' Cushites.
See thou, the things that crawl like worms? That, O Cushites, is to
whom thou hath burnt thy children upon the altar. That O' Cushites, is
for whom thou hath murdered, enslaved and tortured the billions of
Innocents. <br><br>But despair not, O' Cushites, for thy gods will not
remain humbler than thy small toe. Let us skip ahead another ten
thousands years. <br><br>Thou know these, doth thou not O' Cushites?
Thought thou, these, just some giant, pea brain beasts who appeared and
disappeared with no mark? No, O' Cushites, think harder. If thou has
advanced from digging thy dinner out of the ground with sharp rocks, to
building cities in outer space in a mere 300,000 years, why would thou
believe that these great Beings hath remained unthinking for ten
<span style="font-style: italic;">billion</span> years, when both thee and they are made of the same substance? <br><br>Hail thy god, O' Cushites. <br><br>These are the Saurians. <br><br>Now Let us move on. Heed while I chronicle for thee, a tale of history. <br><br></font></div>
