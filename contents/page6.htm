<div align="left"><font class="fsx06" face="Arial">The first of living things to emerge from the womb of the mother of all, were the crawling worms that became the Saurians. <br><br>For many millenniums these great creatures roamed the earth when no other beast was in existence. <br><br>They
evolved into many different kinds, shapes and types of creatures, and
because they were of the same substance, born of the same seed and
incubated inside the womb of the same mother, neither big Saurians, or
small Saurians, or those who walked on two legs, or those who walked
about on fours, or those who crawled on their bellies, or those who
sprouted wings; thought they were an individual, or different. They all
thought with one brain wave and there was no conflict upon all the
earth <br><br>And it was, that while the Saurians were the first to
roam the earth, the womb of the mother of all, never stopped giving
birth to new creatures of all shapes, types and kinds, which no
Imagination, Artist, or Creator, would have taken the time to think of,
paint, or design. <br><br>Because there was peace and harmony in the
universe, all the new creatures emerged without trauma or awareness, so
they all thought they were one with the entire universe. No creature
had to heighten its senses as it was born, so all living things emerged
thinking and acting as one. <br><br>Many more eons passed, which ye O'
Cushites, shall never learn of except by means of these documents
because all records have been destroyed that the truth may be buried. <br><br>But I, who am the son of woman, know all things that cometh after the history of the unknowable One. <br><br>Discover
now, O' Cushite, the origins of evil and the corruption of an universe
that was created to be a paradise for all living things. <br><br></font></div>
