<p align="center">Marduk and lady Lil </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"How dare you, Marduk!"</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Marduk looked at his mother. Life in Babylon had been
good to her...or bad, depending on whether he measured it against what
he wanted for her, or what he wanted for Babylon. Long ago she told him
she was born of Cushite royalty. Everyday it showed more and more in
the way she carried herself and in her temperament. He was happy that
she was getting so much love and devotion from the Adamites. But he
could see that she was being warped by it just as he knew would happen.
</font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"What are you talking about, Meri?"</font></font><font size="4"> He took her coat and helped her seat herself; not because she was feeble and old, but because she seemed to expect it. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You know very well what I'm talking about, Marduk! How dare you
introduce ritualistic sacrifice into this new world? You know what my
people went through in Atlantis." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>For a minute he had no idea what she was referring to, but then it
dawned on him she was speaking about the new articles ratified into the
Babylonian Constitution. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Have you read the new Article, Meri? It's not ceremonial sacrifice.
All the law calls for, is humiliation of the king. Sethis did submit
such a motion for fear that in the future, Tyrants will place
themselves over the people, but his motion was roundly defeated." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Horus will one day be king. Will you really have one born of the house of Cush struck in the face before all of Babylon?" </p></font></font><font size="4">

<p></p>

<p>He smiled at how she had come to him exaggerating. She did read the
article. Or some one fully briefed her on what it stated. She also knew
about Sethis' failed motion. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Yes I will Mother. It was my Idea, and now it's the law of the land. Horus <i>may </i>one day be king, but I'm king now and the law is in full effect as of yesterday." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">She looked like she was going to faint. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Have
you lost your mind, Merodach? To think of Horus being so shamed in
front of all of Babylon was preposterous, but you...who will dare
strike you in the face?" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Sethis is high Priest. It is his duty." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Her tone softened with the look in her eyes. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Merodach,
sometimes I think you lose yourself so much in the world of your dreams
that you barely live in the real world. Sethis will never strike you." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"He was a member of the Council that ratified the article. And he knows what his duties are." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Yes, but he most likely thought the law was meant for future kings,
not you. Merodach, you know your siblings, to even think about
humiliating you in their dreams would send them into frenzy, but before
the entire world...be realistic." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Meri, The laws of Babylon are what will make her future. They are
not drawn up and ratified frivolously. They are not to be applied by
the whims and prerogatives of the self-important. They are bigger than
houses, men, women, gods, or lords--no matter how important they think
them and their pride to be. And no one is above the law, <i>no one</i>.
All of Babylon will witness the new law in effect six months from now,
and every year at the same time, after that. It will be ceremony,
celebration, as well as duty, it is called Akitu, and it shall become
so ingrained in the culture and minds of the people of Babylon they
will expect their right to Akitu as they expect their right to
breathe." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"And what do you think such lowering of the house of Cush will do to
the Igigis when you leave us, Merodach? How many times have you told me
that your time with us is limited? " </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"First, Mother, why are you so sure that the future of the throne
belongs to the house of Cush? The Gebonites and Sethites are much more
numerous. And both are more ruthless and ambitious. What about the
Adamites...whose to say that one day their internal need to grovel will
not be bred out of future generations? Have you realized yet, the folly
of your scheme, Meri?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"The house of Cush is the most revered by all in Babylon. It needs
to stay that way or the Hybrids will enslave my children. How can we
maintain what the Adamites have raised unto us if you strip us of our
majesty?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"That's the whole point, Meri; you can, and will not. The house of
Cush will not control the destiny of Babylon. The Adamites will. Either
the Adamites control the future, or the demons will control everyone,
because the Adamites are the only ones who have no ambitions but to
live in peace and contentment. Give the power to the people, Mother,
and teach them to hold it and guard it with the utmost jealousy, or
Babylon will never know anything but the hell of division, the
strivings of the ambitious, and all the torment that goes along with
it." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Marduk, please--" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"You knew I wouldn't accommodate your plot, Mother." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"My plot?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Come now, Mother...long live the king? I never wanted that kind of
hierarchy introduced in Babylon but we all knew that once the Adamites
got whiff of the idea they would yearn for nothing else. Horus would
never have so blatantly betrayed me on his own initiative. Nothing to
be done about it now. They will have their king. But I shall defang him
like a toothless daggercat" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">Tears flooded her eyes.</font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">
"Betrayal? How dare you accuse me of betraying you? You do not hear or
see what goes on under your own nose. The whispers, the mumbling. I did
it for you Merodach...for the Igigi. " </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"Why would you think that you know something that goes on in Babylon
that I am unaware of? I, who have seen the Hybrids before Nut gave
birth to the first one of them?&#8221; </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"If you knew, why did you let that babe live Merodach? You promised me...you promised.</font></font><font size="4">" She sobbed. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"What did I promise you, Meri?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"That my children will never be slaves again." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">He thought she was going to say something else. With this she was right.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="4">&nbsp;</font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Yes
I did, but I never promised them Lordship, or privilege above others. I
can, and will keep my true promise, Meri, but only if the ones I count
on the most to stand by me, do not work against me." </font></font></p>


<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"You knew, Merodach. You should have killed that babe. Was one life worth the future of all the Innocents of this new world?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>He had to struggle to keep down the sickness bubbling up inside him.
Her aura glowed with an intensity that hit him like a wall of evil,
even though it wasn't evil. It was the first time he had felt the
energy of fear and love bring up in him the same sickness as pure evil.
It took great effort to not want to engage her, much more to calm his
tone. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"I tried to keep the Cushites from breeding with the Adamites,
Mother, but even then I knew it wasn't a real solution. From the
beginning of time such efforts has failed. The Ancients Ones, failed to
keep the Saurians from breeding with the WoMans. Onanes failed to keep
the WoMans, in the beginning, from breeding with the other species. The
Guild failed to keep the Lords from breeding with the Cushites. I never
thought I could prevent it, Meri. I had just hoped I could have
prevented it from happening too soon. I wanted time. But once the babe
was implanted, it would have been no solution to kill it, only grave
evil, for then where does the killing stop? It's true the Hybrids are
highly susceptible to demonic manipulation, but if the demons had no
better choice they could raise up rocks to oppose and stumble me. How
do I kill the rocks, Meri? How about the wind, the trees, the
ground...my own beloved?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>She listened to him quietly--with growing wonder, and though
intellectually, she still was not exorcised of her fears, in her heart,
her spirit, she had become a believer, a devoted disciple of her own
son. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Who are you, Merodach? What are you...that you have no wants, no
desires, no pride or ambition? No fears? Your speech is not of this
earth, your ways...who has been like you in this world?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">He looked in her eyes and saw that she really
expected answers to her questions. Most times he didn't understand
himself--or know himself. Who was he? The son of this woman sitting
before him? The son of Bel Lil? The adopted son of the unknowable One?
He knew no more of who he was than she, but he did know who had
influenced him most in the way he spoke and acted. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">During the twenty years he spent exiled on Jupiter,
he had read and meditated on every word the great Sage of Indo, has
ever been said to have spoken or taught. As his Mother marvels at his
speech today, he had marveled at the incredible truth, understanding,
and wisdom of the great Indo Martyr. And the more he read and studied
the Sage, the more he marveled, and the more of himself he lost into
the great Sage's words, ways, and legacy.<br>
&nbsp;Sometimes he thought himself to be that One, who freed the
Universe of Saurian evil. Sometimes, he felt that the great Sage was in
him, spoke through his lips, walked with his legs, loved with his
heart. The most amazing thing was that everyday that he lived,
witnessed, and experienced the world around him, the more real the
great martyr of Indo became to him. Every event proved the truthfulness
of his words and the outer worldly essence of his wisdom. The great
Sage <i>knew</i>. He knew the world, he knew the Universe, he knew the
demons, he knew man, he knew the animals, he knew the past, the future,
he knew the unknowable One, and he understood it all--knew the minds of
it all, the whys of it all, the purpose of it all, and the striving of
it all. He did not teach words, ideas, or stories, he taught
profoundness. Every day that passed proved that he spoke with deep
understanding and knowing of everything that has happened, is happening
and will happen.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Being a born sorcerer, he also had an ability to see
and discern some of what the future held. But the great Sage saw
everything, and he saw it all, a long time ago. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">He said to his Mother:</font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"> "I am your son, Meri, but if what you are asking is what has made me who---" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"I think of him often when I see you sometimes...listen to you talk." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"How do you know who I mean?"</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"How can I not know? There is none else like you." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"I have studied him Mother...to discover how he freed the Universe.
The solution I seek for the people of Babylon is as eternal as what he
gave the people of Indo. Kingship is temporary, power is fleeting.
pride is propped up on shifting sands, but freedom,
Meri...freedom--when it is engraved upon the heart, lives forever, and
it never stops dreaming and reaching. But it does not dream and reach
for the few, the chosen, or the special, it dreams and reaches for
every one, -- the lowly, the ugly, the misshapen, the ignorant, the
poor. Freedom, is the ultimate love, and the only true love. Do you
know what the great Sage has taught me about freedom, Meri?"</p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Tell me, Merodach."</font></font><font size="4">
As big as he was, his eyes were wide with the wonder of a child. She
never got the chance to mother him when he was a boy. She would keep
him in this conversation forever if she could just to hold on to this
moment. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"He has taught me that freedom does not want, it does not desire, it
does not store for the future. He has taught me that freedom leaves no
one out, or behind and it will make a billion successful souls sit in
wait for that one lost soul to catch up, because freedom understands
that no one is happy, or reaches paradise, until every one walks
through the gate together. He taught me that freedom knows that no one
is free until, and unless everyone is free." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

</font><p><font size="4">He paused and took a breath.</font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"> "Do you understand what I&#8217;m saying, Meri...why the need for Akitu?" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"I understand you, Merodach. I have always understood you. You are
not like us. We can not see what you see. It is impossible for us to
live in your world just as you will never be able to ground yourself to
the here and now reality of our world." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"You understand nothing." </font></font><font size="4">He said sadly. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Oh, but I really do, Merodach. I believe you. I believe <i>in</i>
you. And I know that one day you will do all that you dream for the
future of the people of Babylon. But I am not a daughter of the future,
I am a child of the past, and all its horrors and insecurities have
limited my ability to see so far. I want security and happiness for the
Igigis now." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"You
disappoint me...very much. You and Horus and the others. I would have
hoped you all would have reached the self ascendancy of Sethis by now."</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">It hurt...deep down inside her to see him so without
understanding of how much he was really loved by his family. Yes, she
wanted the house of Cush to control the future of Babylon. Yes, she
wanted Horus to be king after him. Yes, she feared the Hybrids. But for
her and the rest of the Igigis, it was not really about any of that. It
was about him. The house of Cush will never allow the Hybrids to so
much as take his name in vain;take from him his spot. Never! </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Merodach,"</font></font><font size="4"> she pleaded. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I
know one day you will fulfill your destiny, but you are not grounded in
this world. You see and you know everything I do but it is impossible
for you to give urgency to anything here because you are too enmeshed
with the future. </font></font></p>

<p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">You
know how the Hybrids plot but you do not give it the gravity it will
mean for the immediate future of the people of Babylon because you can
only really see the far future. In the meantime the Igigis and Adamites
will suffer. " </font></font></p>

<p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"There will be suffering no matter what we do. Whether it be the
Hybrids or the Sumerian Sorcerers, themselves, evil is coming upon all
the people of Babylon. That's exactly why the focus should be on
purifying the people's atoms so they can join the free citizens of the
Universe, and not on trying to stave off the inevitable. The sooner the
people of Babylon purify their atoms, the sooner we can leave this evil
sphere."</p>

<p></p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Again she was stirred in her soul by his sincerity and passion but she was still not convinced. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"Merodach do you know where Geb is?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>The question shocked him. Surely his Mother knew that Geb had to be
dead. No Adamite or Hybrid lived longer than 5000 years and a living
Geb would be over 9000 years old. Why would...impossible, was his first
thought, but being a Sorcerer he knew the word had no place in his
vocabulary. Geb was alive. He sensed it now that his Mother brought the
Adamite's aura into his field of thought. </p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>He hadn't thought about Geb in centuries; hadn't seen him since he
healed the boy after Horus' unfortunate attack on him. It was clear Geb
wanted to be left alone after then, and he thought it was the least the
sorely wronged, young Adamite deserved. So he had left him
alone...physically and mentally. </p>

<p></p>

<p>There was always something strange about Geb and it wasn't just his
light skin or abnormal size. If the Nomelan was alive, he was an even
more remarkable person than he thought him to be long ago when he
showed no anger at what Horus did to him. With such robust sons biting
at the bit to take over Babylon, Geb could easily try to get power and
revenge. If he is alive, he must know of the opportunities that awaits
him just for the taking. With their Father as a beacon to the unite
them, the Gebonites could not only crush the house of Cush, they could
mount a serious challenge to him--enough to be more than an annoyance
anyway. He would never use destructive sorcery against any of the
WoMans, so he would have to gather up men to fight men which is the
last thing he wanted to do. With all the problems already on his plate,
he was grateful Geb has shown himself to be so different from his sons.
He could only hope he stay that way. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He knew of the accusations that his Mother had spies throughout
Babylon. He didn't want to confront her so he didn't try to find out if
the rumors were true. Now he knew they <i>were</i> truth, but didn't
she tell him about Geb before now? Lady Lil was becoming a real
headache. He knew from his first conversation with her that she had
ways and personalities that clashed, but it seemed her humble side was
losing out completely to her harder edged nature. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"I imagine he would be dead of old age by now. Why do you ask?"</font></font><font size="4"> He probed. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">She smiled in response. As enigmatic a smirk as he has ever seen on any demon. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"And Djhuty."</font></font><font size="4"> She said. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Do you know where Djhuty is, Merodach?" </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>Another person he hadn't thought about in a long time. In the
beginning he had watched Djhuty closely, but there was never a negative
report against the man. Even Nut could find nothing on him and for a
long time he was very disappointed. He thought sure the Priest would
slip. And he had so wanted to repay the man for all he had done to his
Mother and his young siblings. </p>

<p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"It is no crime to lose yourself in Babylon. Is there a reason I should know of his whereabouts, Mother?" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

<p>"There is a reason for you to know about a lot of things, Merodach. That's what I have been trying to tell you." </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">

<p>"If you know something I should act upon Mother, just tell me. I have no time for--" </p>

<p></p></font></font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Find Geb, Merodach." </font></font><font size="4">She interrupted him. And before he could respond she stood, reclaimed her coat and returned to stand before him. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"I'm sorry for what happened three days ago. We didn't mean...thank A-tom, no one was killed." </font></font><font size="4">Her eyes glistened. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Such
like will never happen again. But I will never stop trying to protect
you, Merodach. I will never go against your will again, but there are
ways to look after you that don't involve challenging you and I shall
not miss a one." </font></font></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>She turned and was gone. </p></font></body></html>
