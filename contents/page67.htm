</font></b><p align="center"><b><font size="6">Geb and Djhuty </font></b></p>

<p></p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">"I should've killed you 9000 years ago when I had the chance."</font></font><font size="4">
Djhuty glared his disgust at Geb, as he watched the Adamite leaning
back smoking. Geb's ass was as big as the back of a Tonbig now. The
Nomelan freak wouldn't lift his hand to take a piss, if he thought
someone would hold his rod for him. If it wasn't for the god, he would
have killed the lazy bastard long ago. But the god protected the
worthless mound of useless flesh for some reason. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Geb never turned his head to look in Djhuty's
direction, but he still managed to blow smoke that snaked its way right
up into the Priest's face. </font><font color="#800040" size="4"><font color="#800040" size="4">"If you don't shut up and bring me some more smoke, I'm going to kill you <i>right</i> now."</font></font><font size="4">
Geb had long ago learned that the Priest feared him for some reason. He
didn't know why. He never hurt the old pathetic god, and he had no
intentions of harming him. But he had seen how cruel and vicious the
weak god is, so he had no qualms about taking advantage of that fear.
He enjoyed pushing the Priest around. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font size="4">Djhuty balled his half a hand into the best fist he could manage, which meant only the thumb on that hand balled. </font></p>

<p></p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">

</font></font><p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">"All you do is sat on that urn eating and smoking!" </font></font><font size="4">Djhuty raged </font><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">"Look at you, you fat..."</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Suddenly Djhuty felt something grip his chest organ
like a vice. It squeezed hard. Then it began to squeeze harder. The god
snarled inside his head. </font><i><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"I warned thee, vermin slave, not to talk to my ss-- thy superior in that tone."</font></font></i><font size="4">
Djhuty opened his mouth to scream but no sound escaped his lips. Geb
heard him hit the floor of the cave and when he saw the Priest's eyes
bulging out their sockets, he hoisted his 300 pound frame with
unprecedented swiftness and was quickly kneeling at the Priest's side. </font><font color="#800040" size="4"><font color="#800040" size="4">"What's the matter? Father, what's wrong? " </font></font></p><font size="4">

<p>As if something had angered him anew, the god tightened the vice he
had on Djhuty's heart. Blood seeped out of every orifice in Djhuty's
body, and it managed one weak audible gasp before it was still forever.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>The god exited Djhuty's lifeless body and entered into Geb. The
moment before, Geb felt tears welling up inside him for the Priest.
Although he never liked the strange god, Djhuty had taken care of him
for 9000 years. Without Djhuty, he would have killed himself long ago,
or starved to death. He had no will to live. </p>

<p>A moment ago he wanted to cry, then suddenly he wanted to kick the
dead Priest for all the animals he had watched him torture and burn. He
fought the urge to do either. Instead he dragged the Priest outside the
cave and although the first work he had done in centuries nearly killed
him, he managed to dig a hole big enough to cover the Priest. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He was three days recovering from the exertion. The first time he
heard the voice in his head, he thought he was still recovering, but he
quickly learned he was not asleep and it was not a dream. The voice had
ways of letting him know that it was no mere figment of his
imagination, or malfunction of his brain. The voice was like a
bumblebee buzzing inside his head and its annoyance was more dreaded
than the exercises it insisted that Geb do every morning. To shut the
voice up was the only thing that could have led to the new Geb--the
Geb, who six months after the Priest died,-- at the age of over 9000
earth years, was stronger and fitter physically, than he had ever been
in his life. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If he thought it would kill the voice in his head, he would use the
Priest's blotout to blow his brains out. But he knew that wouldn't hurt
the voice or whomever the voice belonged to at all. </p>

<p>He would be dead, and the voice would just move on to torment someone else. </p>

<p></p>

<p>To another it might have been a point for gratitude that thanks to
the voice he was trimmer and looking even better than he did when he
first met the beautiful goddess, nine centuries ago. But for him it
only conjured up more hatred for the voice. What need him of a handsome
face or body? He can never be with a woman again. Never be with<i> her</i>. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Goddess. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Since the voice forced him to stop smoking, he started thinking
about her again. The same old painful thoughts. As if all that had
occurred with her, happened yesterday instead of nine thousand years
ago. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The young god never meant to hurt him. He knew that even as he lay
writhing on the ground in agony holding his smashed privates. That's
why he had never been able to stir up the inner hatred the strange god
held him in such contempt for not feeling. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The strange god called himself a Priest. It was a good thing he had
a heart attack. He knew that the strange god was a pathetically weak
god. Nothing like the big Lord, Marduk. He enjoyed telling himself that
the Priest's sudden death saved him the trouble of killing the shrill
himself. In reality though, he had never been able to bring himself to
kill anything. <br>
</p>
<p>He didn't know why the voice made him bury the Priest. The strange god never buried anything he tortured and killed. </p>


<p></p>

<p>He hasn't done so much thinking since the last time he saw <i>her</i>.
He remembered clearly the last time he saw the goddess. Her standing
there, big as a Tonbig --pregnant, trying to get his attention. For
what? What could he give, or do for her? He was a useless sapling with
nothing. Not even a phallus to pleasure her with. </p>

<p></p>



<p>All he wanted to do then, and all he wanted to do now, is smoke
until he died. He couldn't even have that. Not only doesn't he die
early, he lives almost twice as long as anyone else of his kind...with
no signs of ill health or death in sight. Feeling better physically now
than he ever had in his life. Thinking better too. At least clearer.
The Priest always nagged that smoking root so much was going to kill
him.<br>
There was something to gloat about in that, considering how much he despised the strange god. But he didn't feel like laughing. </p>

<p></p>

<p>No, the voice has done him no favor. Feeling good and thinking
clearly only brings out hungers in a person. Desires, he had spent
9,000 years trying to suppress. Thinking about her all the time now.
Remembering all those times behind the rocks with her. How good it
felt-- she felt-- sitting astride him. It does him no good at all to
think about and remember those things with such clarity. </p>

<p></p>

<p>She has given him many, many sons. The Priest told him that. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The voice has taken up where the dead Priest left off. Talking about
kingship and ruling the world. As if he wanted to rule this cave, much
less the world. He had no intentions of using his sons to take over the
world. He don't know them. They don't know him. They are brutal
people--his sons. Disrespectful of the gods and cruel to his Mother's
people. The Priest told him about this as if it was something that he
should be proud of. Proud of arrogance and cruelty. A-dom! He is glad
that old slitherbit is dead! </p>
