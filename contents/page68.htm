<p align="center"></p>

<p></p><font size="4">

<p>When Enki slew Apsu, the energy released not only woke up Mother
Tiamat, it also woke up Apsu's father, Azog, the granddaddy of all
Saurians. And he wasn't happy as he search for a body to house his
ethereal form.<br>
 </p>

<p>The kind of host, the disembodied Saurian sought out, was one he
sensed would be best for his majesty, needs and purposes. The Azog
entered Thoth. But after seeing Thoth's interaction with the beast,
Geb, all he wanted to do was exit Thoth, leaving Thoth's crushed atoms
in his wake.</p>

<p>The Azog could barely contain his rage but before he destroyed Thoth, he wanted some kind of explanation.</p><b><i>

</i></b><p><b><i>"Why did thou not crush that insolent beast"</i></b><i> </i>The Azog demanded inside of Thoth's head.</p>

<p>Thoth had no real answer. He knew he should have. No other vermin
would have survived two seconds defying him the way Geb did. But Geb
was his first born son. There was something about Saurians and their
firstborn sons that defied reason. He had seen it played out over and
over again. How the most ruthless Saurian, would become like beastwomen
when it came to their first born sons. The Guild had long taken noticed
of the strange phenomenon. During the civil war with Enlil and the
other rebel Lords, they had tortured and killed all the sons of the
rebel Lords in front of their faces as a deterrent as well as a
punishment. Some of them wanted to do the same to Enlil's son, Marduk,
but Thoth managed to convince them that the satisfaction wouldn't have
been worth the price. Enlil was giving up in a war that amounted to
nothing more than a fight for the right to breed with igigi women, but
he would never give up a war of revenge over the Guild torturing
and killing his firstborn son.<br>
 </p>

<p>Such irrational worship of their own firstborn sons, was why
Saurians often demand that people, they plan to use for any purpose,
kill <span style="font-style: italic;">their</span> firstborn sons as the ultimate show of loyalty. They are so
enamored of their own, they find it impossible to believe all other Beings don't feel the same.</p>

<p>Thoth never thought he could succumb to such weakness. Then again, he never thought he would have a son.<br>
Females were not his choice of sexual pleasure. He dirtied himself with
a female only to give birth to another instrument to aid in his quest
to&nbsp; take over the earth. That's all he expected Geb to mean to
him. But he discovered he was not immune to the weakness.<br>
 </p>

<p>He couldn't kill his son.</p><b><i>

</i></b><p><b><i>"Answer me, fool!"</i></b><i> </i>The Azog thundered.</p>

<p>Thoth's unrivaled thought process was churning a mile a minute. He had to get the Azog off his son, and out of him.</p></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"Great father of time, why dost though lower thyself inside the
inferior likeness of one such as I? There lives one who is much more
worthy of thy magnificence. Oh great Lord of the ages, may I tell thee
of this one, who alone is worthy to house thy brilliancy?"</p>

<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Azog was as much moved by the talk
of a worthy host as he was by the flattery. He needed a host to
concentrate his atoms enough to be more than just a wide open force of
energy, so vast, he was really nothing.</p></font></font><b><i><font size="4">

</font></i></b><p><b><i><font size="4">"Speak freely, fool! And
quickly, for I shalt have my vengeance for having to witness that--that
disgraceful display thou put me through."</font></i></b></p>

<p><font size="4">Thoth spoke fast:</font></p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"There is one called, Inanna, oh Ancient of days, she--"</p></font></font><font size="4">

<p><i>--Inanna...A bitch's name!</i> The Azog flared so much, Thoth felt like he was being ripped apart from the inside<b><i>. "Thou suggest that I--" </i></b></p>

<p>A lesser Being would have exploded into a million pieces but Thoth's
strong sorcery immediately formed a shield to hold his atoms together.
It still took everything he had to speak.</p></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"Thou knoweth Almighty one, that the female has always been the mightiest Saurian warrior."</p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>Thoth felt the pressure lessen.</p>

<p>The female side of the Saurian bisexual nature had always been the
ruler of the Saurian collective, until Ki, the serpent, killed the last
female to rule. The Azog once carried that dual nature Itself. Now it
was formless. <br>
</p>
<p>Since the Saurian queens has lost everything for the First Ones of
the earth, except their tenuous hold on the earth's solar system, the
male side of the Saurian dual nature developed a deep hatred for its
female side. Saurians like Inanna, who insisted on holding on to their
female natures, solely, were rebels in and of themselves...rebels
against a long running tradition of change, born of the humiliation and
insecurity caused by defeat. </p>


<p>The Azog exited Thoth and floated all around him, shimmering. <i><span style="font-weight: bold;">"How will I know this Inanna, for I have been long in stillness?"</span> </i></p></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">

<p>"Thou will know her Highest. When the time comes, just follow the trail of death and destruction of the beasts."</p></font></font><font size="4">

<p>The Azog had no form, but even without a face or lips to mold it,
Thoth could clearly see in his mind's eye, the trait so indicative of
his kind.</p></font></body></html>
