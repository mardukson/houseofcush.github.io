And each of them was weeping. </p><p></p><p>Marduk
looked at the Priest, his youngest brother, with surprise. He knew how
the other Cushites felt, but Sethis was different. He had always been
different. If there was anybody who was more anti-kingship than
himself, it was Sethis. Not only that, Sethis was an accomplished
Magician--especially for a WoMan. Being a Sorcerer, Sethis saw, and
understood the truths of the Universe far better than the others.
Besides that, the man was high Priest, keeper of the laws and
traditions of Babylon. </p><p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"It is your duty." </font></font><font size="4">The
tears annoyed Marduk even more than the obstinacy. They all acted as if
what he was asking was of the greatest significance in all creation,
when in the scheme of things it was nothing. They were bogging down in
the middle of a great cosmic enterprise, over nothing. </font></p><p></p><p><font size="4">Sethis removed the signet ring that symbolized his position. </font><font color="#408080" size="4"><font color="#408080" size="4">"I quit."</font></font><font size="4"> He held out the ring to Marduk. </font></p><p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"><p>"It
is not my prerogative to strip you of the honor the people of Babylon
has bestowed upon you but if you will not do your duty, I will find
someone who will, so the law may be obeyed. The people will be informed
of your dereliction of duty, so that they may vote into your place
someone more deserving of their trust." </p><p></p></font></font><font size="4"><p>Sethis'
already wet face crumbled and he reached out like a hurt two year old
to Marduk with the hand holding the ring. Marduk turned away from him. </p><p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"><p>"Will no one step forward...for Babylon?" </p><p></p></font></font><font size="4"><p>They all stared down at the floor with bent heads. </p><p></p></font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"I thought you understood." </font></font><font size="4">Marduk
said softly. He turned to the young scribe--a Sethite--whose job it was
to record for all posterity, every council session that concerned
Babylon and its citizens. </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Call General Samson, the son of Geb, and bring him to this place." </font></font><font size="4">The young woman nodded and exited the room. </font></p><p></p><p><font size="4">Samson
is the young Gebonite who had wanted so much to go on the mission to
greet the ship that carried Bel Lil. He was a hulking, muscular man,
with long ropey hair that fell down to the middle of his back. His
strength was legendary. He was the first Hybrid that Horus had ever let
join the security forces but that was only because Marduk insisted.
Since then, the security forces of Babylon had been run without
discrimination. Marduk knew there was a risk in that. But he had
decided that Babylon was going to stay true to her intent if it
destroyed her. </font></p><p></p><font color="#ff8080" size="4"><font color="#ff8080" size="4"><p>"What are you doing, Father?"</p></font></font><font size="4"><p>Marduk ignored Nephetis' question. </p><p></p></font><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">"No one will strike you in the face, Father.&#8221;</font></font><font size="4"> Shu lifted his head for the first time since entering the room. His eyes were lit with tears and fierceness. </font></p><p></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"><p>"The
just and righteous laws of Babylon will be obeyed. If none of you will
honor her mandates, I'm sure Samson, the son of Geb, will not shirk his
duty to Babylon." </p><p></p></font></font><font color="#804040" size="4"><font color="#804040" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#804040" size="4"><font color="#804040" size="4">"Then Samson, the son of Geb, will die this day." </font></font><font size="4">Horus looked Marduk straight in the eye. </font></p><p></p><p><font size="4">Lady Lil moved to stand between Marduk and Horus. </font><font color="#0080ff" size="4"><font color="#0080ff" size="4">"Will you make murderers of all my sons? I told you they would not--" </font></font></p><p></p><font size="4"></font><p><font size="4">Marduk raised his hand like a shield between them </font><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4">"Sit down, Mother...please.&#8221;</font></font><font size="4"> He turned again to address them all. </font></p><font color="#800080" size="4"><font color="#800080" size="4"><p>"Samson,
the son of Geb, is the only one I know who is brave enough to do this
great thing in face of the rage of the house of Cush. But know this:
What the son of Geb does to protect Babylon, her just and righteous
laws, and her people, will leave him far from being alone. He will not
only have me standing by him, he will have all of Babylon standing with
him. I brought you all--my beloved--here because I knew how hard this
would be for you. I wanted this great thing to be done by you, for the
sake of the honor of our house, but if the house of Cush must be
humiliated this day, by the house of Geb, in order for Babylon to be
true to her goals, then so be it. One last time, I ask, who will be
true to Babylon this day." </p><p></p></font></font><font size="4"></font><p><font size="4">Horus stood up straighter in the face of Marduk. </font><font color="#804040" size="4"><font color="#804040" size="4">"And again I say no one will strike you in the face father, and live."</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p><p></p><p><font size="4">Nut
looked at Marduk and saw something in his eyes she never saw
before...pure hurt. She was solidly with her brothers. ..until she saw
that look. She stepped forth. </font></p><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4">"I'll do it," </font></font><font size="4">she said softly. Nephetis reached out and grabbed her by a sleeve. She snatched her arm free. </font><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4">"I&#8217;ll do it."</font></font><font size="4">
Nut said louder. She looked into Horus' angry glare and held his stare.
The muscles in Horus' jaw jumped and the hands at his side clenched and
unclenched. For what seemed an eternity of tension, he glared at his
pregnant wife, seemingly willing her to step back. Nut took another
step forward. </font><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4">"I'll do it,"</font></font><font size="4"> she repeated. Horus dropped his eyes and it was he who visibly retreated. </font></p><p></p><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4">"Come Marduk."</font></font><font size="4"> She took him by the hand. </font><font color="#0080c0" size="4"><font color="#0080c0" size="4">"Let's get this over with before I lose my nerve." </font></font></p><p></p><font size="4"><p>Marduk
walked with Nut, the short distance from his home to the council
building. From there they were driven to the ceremony field. Marduk was
determined that Akitu be performed in real time before the people so no
future king could deal in deception.</p><p>Nut thought the sky bluer
than she had ever seen it. The grass greener. The murmurs and crowd
sounds of the people were loud...louder than she had ever experienced
before. Her senses were in an extremely heightened state and as she
looked up at Marduk, she realized it was because she was terrified; not
of what she was about to do; not of the people or her family, but of
everything; what was, and what will be. Everything was about to change.
She sensed it. Marduk was making a grave mistake. A mistake all of
Babylon will one day sorely regret. She understood him. She knew what
drove him. What made him. His fanatical sense of justice was
unrealistic in the real world. Sometimes there was a need for
strength--even strength propped up by force and illusion--for the
wellbeing of all. </p><p>Marduk was determined to undermine not only
the godhood status the Adamites had given him, but the high status and
power of the house of Cush, itself. She believed in him so she knew
that in the long run everything he was doing is right. But like her
Mother and the rest of her family, she had come up from the hell of
slavery and tasted power. How could she not fear the slightest erosion
of that power and the security it provided? Even if she knew it was
short term and more illusion than real. It will still last her
lifetime. </p><p></p><p>She couldn't remember hitting him in the face,
but she knew she must have done it because she did recall something
crashing against her forehead. After that she remembered nothing. </p><p>She
was told that she had been bed-ridden for seven days. She lay there and
thought of her husband, with anger. Horus had given Babylon the
infernal gift that just keeps on giving. Two bloody riots within a
single year. </p><p></p><p>Marduk and the Council had prepared for the
first Akitu--so they thought. There had been many open field test
sessions with Marduk addressing the people of Babylon since the first
one that ended so tragically. Even though the Council knew the much
greater risk of Akitu, the people had been educated about the Ceremony.
They knew what would happen. So why did they explode? Why were two
hundred Babylonians killed and thousands more seriously injured? Marduk
had to once again use sorcery to limit the damage. </p><p>There was
something more to the events of that day than what initially met the
eye. This was not a people's uprising against Akitu. </p><p>After she
slapped Marduk, she was told, there was a great gasp, but no outbursts
until someone yelled and threw a bottle with pinpoint accuracy into the
middle of her forehead. It was never discovered, who threw the bottle
but it sent the Gebonites into a frenzy. She is their first mother. </p><p>The
Horites killed 25 Gebonites that day while trying to contain their
rampage. Two Horites were killed. The rest of the dead were Adamites,
killed by the Gebonites. The Gebonites had the atmosphere charged with
such a potent energy of rage and fear, it took the sleep spell Marduk
cast, over half an hour to start taking effect on even the Adamites. On
the Gebonites and Horites, it took longer. </p><p></p><p>As she
replayed what she was told of the events of that day over in her mind,
Nut suddenly realized she hadn't seen Marduk since she was hurt. Until
now, she was too weak and drowsy to think or focus on what was
happening, or not happening around her. If Marduk had been there to see
her, she wasn't aware of it. If he hadn't visited her, something was
seriously wrong. She bolted upright. Of course something was seriously
wrong! Over two hundred Babylonians were dead. She knew Marduk. No one
understood him like she did. He would blame himself. She got up,
ignoring the pain pounding in her head and starting dressing. She had
to find Marduk. </p><p></p><p>Marduk is in trouble! </p></font></body></html>
