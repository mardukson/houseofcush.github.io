<div align="left"><font class="fsx06" face="Arial">In the days before
WoManoids walked the surface of the earth, all things were dominated by
the Saurians, who drew to themselves most of the rays of the sun when
it shone, ate most of the food, drank most of the clear water, and took
for their pleasure,&nbsp; females and males of all creatures that their
phalluses could fit and that their vaginas could feel. <br><br>And it
was, that because the Saurians had no sexual restraint, no creature big
or small, beast or fowl, hesitated to discern when it approached
another to copulate. All were one with the will of the First Ones, and
what doth the giants, so did all other living things. <br><br>Many hybrids and half creatures were formed from thus. <br><br>A
beautiful creation, made to hold an infinite number of different
creatures who never died, had grown grotesque, filled with unbridled
lust and unnatural beasts who set back and disrupted the ascension of
all things because they improved not, but digressed physically and
spiritually. <br><br>Imagine thou, O' Cushites, beasts with 7 heads,
mounted upon the bodies of lions. Beasts with faces of a rodent and
teeth of an daggercat. Beasts with heads of baboons and trunks of
snakes. Mammoth beasts, that breathed fire and flew like birds. Beasts
that perished when rain fell because they lifted their heads and kept
trying to drink e' en when water filled all their orifices, and they
could not breathe. &nbsp;Doubt not O 'Cushites, when I say there were in
these times creatures that were, shall I say...even less cognizant? <br><br>Even
during these days there was peace. No Creature willingly harmed
another, tho' horrific deaths were common from attempted sex acts
between big creatures with those too small and grown beasts with
infants and immature ones. <br><br>E'en today, says you, O 'Cushites,
unthinking beasts prey upon one another and lap up flesh and blood with
no shame or conviction? <br><br>Care thou not, O 'Cushites, what beasts do in the long distant past when no man walked the surface of the earth? <br><br>Then
thou must know that as WoMankind is these days, so would become the
Saurians and other creatures of that ancient past. But e'en when they
became sapient, they did not cease their iniquities. <br><br>When they
acquired knowledge and understanding they no longer tore flesh out of
hunger; but out of lust for the surge gained by the infliction of
domination and pain. <br><br>They no longer used infants and little
ones like wives and husbands because they knew no difference; but
because they would not raise the morals of their flesh as time and
evolution has raised the consciousness of their minds. <br><br>They no
longer held down the ascension of all creatures because they,
themselves, had no dreams; but because they wanted to keep all life
under their control. <br><br>This O 'Cushites, is the age old, collective will of those who now hold sway over the minds of thee and thy children. <br><br>The reality thou suffer is no WoMan's will. <br><br>Know thy enemy O 'Cushites, <br><br>Or perish. <br><br></font></div>
