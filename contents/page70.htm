Sumerian Sorcerers were bunched up around the scan screen in Enki's
small, self proclaimed control room. Not all of the Guild could fit in
the room at the same time and those not present were Anu and Inanna.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Enki was seated. Thoth stood peering over Enki's left
shoulder. Nergal was standing over Enki's right shoulder. Erra, and the
rest of the sorcerers got their looks the best they could. There were
only two chairs in the small room which was built to comfortably
accommodate only two people. The Guild didn't want to waste the time,
manpower and material, building any permanent or opulent structures
because they had no intentions of staying on the moon. Most of those in
the room had to stand or leave. After getting the looks they wanted in
the scan screen, Ereshkigal, Hadad, Apep, Ninhursag, Ishkur and Nanna
left in a huff. </font></p>

</font></font><font size="4">Erra shook the ringing out of his ears and
distanced himself from his loud kin. His own feet were killing him and
the only reason he didn't leave to find somewhere to sit was because he
didn't want to miss anything. Marduk had left the earth. This was a
great development for the Guild. </font></p><p></p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Oh the mysteries of life."</font></font><font size="4"> Enki chuckled. </font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"How can someone so--so powerful, be so--so...Marduk?"</font></font><font size="4"> She clasped her hands together and cackled with glee. </font></p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Let's not get too happy here, chuckles." </font></font><font size="4">Nergal snapped two fingers at his Igigi slave, and waved her away from him and out of the room</font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">."
He'll be back and he's still Marduk. Is strange though...imagine all
that agonizing over the deaths of a handful of phallus dips" </font></font></p><p></p><font size="4"></font><p><font size="4">Enki,
still not all the way back from the transformation he/she made to trap
and murder Apsu, reached back and grabbed at Thoth's inner thigh.
He/she purred, </font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Did thou throw the bottle too?"</font></font><font size="4"> Thoth scowled at the back of her head. He moved out of her reach. </font></p><p></p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4"><p>"I hear some of the toothless ones have been whispering to Mother Tiamat." </p><p></p></font></font><font size="4"><p>Enki's sudden renewed aura sucked from the good mood in the room like a gaping hole in the side of a flying vihanna. </p><p></p></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Just jesting."</font></font><font size="4"> Thoth lied. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"But
if Thou don' t keep thy hands off me, Mother Tiamat's not going to have
anything left to crush if she does find out who murdered Apsu." </font></font></p><p></p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"Where's Marduk?" </font></font><font size="4">Erra,
who seemed to get smaller every time Thoth saw him since being
humiliated and usurped by Nergal, looked at Thoth, eyes shining with
admiration. Thoth wanted to kick him in his shriveled ball sack. He
still hadn't forgotten their fight even if it did happen so long ago he
couldn't even remember who won. Nothing he despised more than a former
killer turned jelly fish. Instead he answered. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Probably at his mansion on Jupiter." </font></font></p><p></p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#808000" size="4"><font color="#808000" size="4">"They can space travel?"</font></font><font size="4"> Erra's two slits for eyes, widened. </font></p><p></p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4"><p>"If thou came to the meetings sometimes, instead of lying around with thy abds all day, thou would have already known that. &#8220; </p><p></p></font></font><font size="4"></font><p><font size="4">Thoth
looked from Erra to Nergal and back to Erra. Nergal was as insulting as
he could be to a fellow Ty-- someone who was born of a higher rank in
their house. But just as he expected,--nothing from the great killer of
old. The corner of Thoth's lips lifted into a sneer. </font></p><p></p><p><font size="4">Thoth said:</font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">
" Unlike thou lazy layabouts, I've been trying to upset things down
there but Marduk is still making great strides in preparing for us. If
we don't get to earth soon we are going to have more trouble than we
can easily handle. " </font></font></p><p></p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">"Don't worry" </font></font><font size="4">Nergal
walked over, grunted and crowded Erra out of the chair the bottom heavy
Ty had finally secured when Enki vacated hers; pushed Erra off his spot
again--ten thousand years after the first time. For a brief instant,
Thoth, who had been watching Nergal's low-key, systematic bullying of
Erra with growing amusement, saw murder in Erra's eyes. But only for a
moment. The flame flared brightly and then flickered out just as fast.
Thoth snickered. </font></p><p></p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">"We'll defeat Marduk." </font></font><font size="4">Nergal
positioned into his infamous lean back, looking more than pleased with
himself as Erra, standing on his aching feet again, glared at the
back of his head. </font><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4">"Our
Ship is ready. We have millions of abds, loyal to us though we'll have
to kill or leave most of them behind. Mother Tiamat has a whole army
down there waiting for us... hidden in the mountains. Some vicious
looking specimens too. ..scared me."</font></font><font size="4"> The big Ty mocked, clearly not the least bit impressed with Mother Tiamat's army.</font><font color="#000080" size="4"><font color="#000080" size="4"> "Thou seen them yet, Ibis?" </font></font></p><p></p><font size="4"></font><p><font size="4">Thoth nodded. </font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4">"Has she called thee, yet?" </font></font></p><p></p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><p>"Yeah, but I have to wait until we get down there. I can't do the projection thing." </p><p></p></font></font><font color="#008000" size="4"><font color="#008000" size="4"><p>"Thou could if thou tried." </p><p></p></font></font><font size="4"></font><p><font size="4">Nergal rankled, sat straight up in the chair. &#8220;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">I</span></font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4"> can break thy warbled neck if I <i>tried </i>too. I suggest thou not <i>try</i> to tell me what to do and just be grateful I don't like to do a whole lot of <i>trying </i>at anything." </font></font></p><p></p><font size="4"><p>Besides
his toughness and fearlessness;by learning to pilot the ship, Nergal
had proven himself to be much more than just some big, dumb bully who
got by on intimidating everyone around him. Thoth didn't fear Nergal,
but like Marduk, the mean spirited Ty, was someone he had grown to
respect. He didn't spar too much with those he respected. He either
fought them to kill, or avoided talk that could lead to things he
wasn't prepared for. He needed Nergal. What he didn't need was any
serious infighting among the members of the Guild. When this was all
over with Marduk and Bel Lil--then he will settle things with the loud
mouth Ty. </p><p></p><p>Enki returned to the room and stood in front
of Nergal, patiently waiting for something. With Nergal showing no
signs of giving it, she coughed. Nergal grinned, put his hands behind
his head and leaned back farther than ever.  </p><p></p><i></i><p><i>Thought thou didn't like upsetting the Eeen.</i> Thoth grinned to himself. </p><p></p></font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">"Get outta my chair, Motdammit!&#8221;</font></font><font size="4"> Enki screamed finally.</font><font color="#ff0080" size="4"><font color="#ff0080" size="4">" I'm the Een!"</font></font><font size="4"> </font></p><p></p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4"></font></font><p><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">"Yes thou are." </font></font><font size="4">Nergal agreed with exaggerated politeness"...</font><font color="#0000a0" size="4"><font color="#0000a0" size="4">But I'm <i>Een </i>the chair." </font></font></p></body></html>
