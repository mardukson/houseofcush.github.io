<P>Where's Marduk? </P>
<P></P>
<P>A slow brewing storm was gathering over Babylon. Marduk hadn't been seen in three weeks. The people were anxious and restless. Word got around that Marduk had taken one of the ships and abandoned them. Women and children set up vigil in front of his house and wailed night and day. Grown men sat at home from their jobs crying in their beer. Even the animals seemed to be in mourning. Runbits didn't run as fast, and they were road kill everywhere. Tonbigs started leaving the jungles and coming to the cities, just one of them blocking traffic in four lanes. Hatebits were hating even more, rearing up on their tiny paws and fighting when confronted instead of fleeing as they normally would. The Gebonites were raising hell in every bar and on every street corner, except they weren't just bullying the Adamites, they were knocking the hell out of each other. The Horites showed no zeal towards keeping the peace in Babylon. </P>

<P>Horus. </P>
<P></P>
<P>This was his moment, his time, his chance to take charge. He had been hungry for this, felt it was his birthright. But when the people of Babylon looked around for some one to guide them, to lead them, to help them through their sadness, their fear, their insecurities, Horus--the future king of Babylon was with his wailing wife Nut, she holding him only slightly tighter than he held on to her, two words on both their trembling lips... </P>
