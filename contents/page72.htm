<P>Marduk my beloved. Why must thou torment me as thou torment thyself? Why dost thou shut me out? Dost thou not know that I feel thy pain e'en more deeply than thee? Dost thou any idea of what it does to me not to be there to soothe thee when thy hurt with such strength? And without thee, how can I soothe myself? Beloved, how do I live, now that I have seen what thy truly love? Why dost thou love the beasts so? If the death of a mere handful of them hurts thee so much, how live I, my own destiny? Thou know about destiny Lord. And thou know Inanna. Would that thou had slain her when even she would have willingly stretched out her neck before thee. She will not allow me to slay us, and she--we--have been invaded by a force that frightens me. </P>

<P>My Lord, ye knew...E'en back in Atlan. How could thou allow this to happen to me? Why hath thy hated me so and thou has so loved the beasts? Inanna will destroy them, for not only is she empowered of the strength of the Azog and her own speciestral hatred; she is now empowered of my jealousy. I do not want to help her Lord, but emotions have weakened my will and stronger atoms overwhelm me. Still, I will fight her. I will never stop fighting her because of what she will do to thee. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Beloved, please strengthen thyself. Do not murder thyself with sorrow over the fate of the beasts. A mere handful is not a drop in the bucket for what Inanna will do. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Marduk, I only wish to perish in the moments that I am alone. Please let me come to thee. I need thee. </P>

<P>Dost thy no longer love me? </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
