<P>Marduk, thou fool. Why doth thou torment her as thou torment thyself? Why dost thou shut us out? Dost thou not know that she feels thy pain e'en more than thy feel thy own? Yes, she feeds me thy pain fool. I shall make thee hurt like thou make us hurt. What hurts thee Marduk? Ah yes, the beasts. Dost thou think thy know pain now Marduk, because a few of them has been killed? You should have never shut us out fool, for now she no longer struggles against me. Thou has hurt her heart and made her jealous. Thou know my destiny. Now there is nothing to restrain me. </P>
