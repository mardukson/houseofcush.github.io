<P align=center>Marduk on Jupiter </P>
<P></P></B></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>There was not time for such self indulgence and he knew it. But he couldn't help it, he needed this...needed regeneration, meditation, renewal, and the only way he could get it was by being alone, completely alone. It was always his way, his strength, his only means to cope with tragedy, especially those born of his own missteps and failures. </P>
<P></P>
<P>How could he not have foreseen it? It was not a question he asked himself out of self pity, but one he needed a real answer to. Akitu will continue. And it will continue with the King of Babylon. For the foreseeable future, that was he. No one in Babylon wanted to strike him and no one wanted to see it done. His mistake was assuming too much. He saw so much farther than the normal person he often forgot how different things might look to others from what they appeared to him. </P>
<P>There should have been a larger educational program to help the people of Babylon really understand the purpose of Akitu. They understood it on the peripheral and they even loved and believed in the Idea...for anybody else but their beloved Marduk, in which case they understood nothing of it at all. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He has been hiding out on Jupiter for three weeks. It was the first time he had been without the company of Isis at night since he left the moon. She had faithfully come to him and filled his lonely nights with love...At least a part of her did. Long ago she had proved to him that she was of two opposite natures. It was why he loved her so much and despised her with equal measure. She was pure love and at the same time as evil as any Saurian he had ever met. He once thought she was a victim--like his mother, but one day she had told him--one side of her told him--that her hatred of the WoMans was not entirely driven by the abuse she received from the demons as a child. It was the Saurian blood in her. In the past the females ruled the Saurian collective, and they had always been the most vicious and warlike of the two genders. </P>
<P>Of course Inanna was half WoMan, which may do more to explain the conflict within her than anything else. Her extreme hatred for WoMankind and her extreme love for him was really the manifestation of how she felt about herself. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He loved her. She once told him that the unknowable One promised her that she would eventually be with him in the end. It was something he held on to dearly. What he had to do was save her from herself. Prevent her from killing the WoMans and making her evil atoms any stronger over her good atoms. It was not too late, but he had to first battle and defeat her. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Not only her, but all the demons. He couldn't do that moping around here. It was time to go home. </P>
<P></P>
<P>His beloved Babylon needed him. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
