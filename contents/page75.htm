<P align=center>THE LORD HAS RETURNED </P>
<P></P></B></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>Marduk was afraid of pandemonium, so his return to earth was as stealthy as his departure. The gateway, the Babylonian Scientists had invented to implement the space program made it possible for anyone who knew the coordinates to travel to and from the earth, undetected by the naked eye. </P>
<P>Nephetis and her team of Cushite Scientists greeted him on his return. It was she who filled him in on the happenings in Babylon during his departure. ` </P>
<P>In his need to get away, he never considered what affect his unexplained absence would have on this place and people. </P>
<P></P>
<P>After his briefing, he left the space center to go home. The men, woman and children of Babylon were still in front of his house, still holding vigil. It was predawn, an eerily dark night but his sharp eyes could clearly see that some of the people were asleep, though most were awake, moaning and praying. He could tell the ministrations had lost a lot of the initial steam. The people were tired; it showed in their lethargic movements and the hoarseness of their raised voices. For a long time he stood, watching and listening, soaking them in, loving them as they loved him. Finally he stepped forward out of the shadows. As if they sensed him before they saw him, a collective murmur arose. A woman shrieked. </P>

<P>"Sssh" </FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>He said, so softly it was loud enough to wake the sleeping. </FONT><FONT color=#800080 size=4><FONT color=#800080 size=4>"Be still."</FONT></FONT><FONT size=4> He walked in the midst of them and sat cross legged on the ground. No one got excited, no words were spoken. Silent communication between the people of Babylon, and the half Saurian, whom they called lord. Finally he stirred. </P>

<P>"When have you last eaten?" </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>"More than three days ago for the Adults Lord." Somebody responded. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"We were on a fast" Another said. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He had guessed so. He closed his eyes. His lips moved like prayer. Words were spoken. None who was near enough to hear him could understand what he said. Then there was a collective gasp from the great multitude who was gathered there with him. Children laughed and tittered with excitement. Most of the people could not see him, but no one jostled. It was as if they didn't need to see him to know and feel he was there. Again they sat in silence, breaking bread together. After a while of that he stood and spoke to the people. </P>

<P>"Tell Babylon to weep no more." </P>
<P></P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=4>
<P>"The Lord has returned!" A man&#8217;s loud, ecstatic voice interrupted him. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Not exactly what Marduk was going to say but the gist of it. </P>
<P></P>
<P>He was back home. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
